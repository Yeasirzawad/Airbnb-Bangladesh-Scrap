Born and brought up in London, moved to Dhaka a while ago and never looked back. Though not the usual direction preferred by most in Bangladesh (nor in the UK it seems!), I love it here.
I am a teacher by profession, with Physics/English teaching experiences in both UK and BD. I had other ventures and realised business was not my forte - thankful to have discovered my shortcomings early enough.
