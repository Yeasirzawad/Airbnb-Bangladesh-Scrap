I normally live abroad but am in dhaka for a while.

I regularly travel and stay in other places, so I can relate to cleanliness and convenience when staying at a place. I would describe myself as a very easy going and friendly chap. I like to eat good home cooked meals and watch comedies to relax. 

We currently have two rooms available on airbnb for minimum stay of one month. We are back on after an interval due to the pandemic.","['Identity', 'Email address', 'Phone number']"
