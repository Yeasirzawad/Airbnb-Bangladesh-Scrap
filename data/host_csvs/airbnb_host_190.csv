I am 42 years old and split my time between Dhaka and London.
My passions in life are property and family! In Dhaka I am a property developer whilst in London I am a property consultant running my own estate agency.

Whilst my wife has been using Airbnb for 8 years now as a platform for short letting our London Properties I am new to the platform. I have decided to try it out to rent out some of my flats in Dhaka. I am trying to make the properties  appealing to international visitors to my home city.","['Identity', 'Email address', 'Phone number', 'Work email']"
