An avid dog lover at heart ! There are a bunch of things that I like to do and for solo travellers, I can always guide them to expeditions in the nearby areas. People consider Siliguri as a gateway town but honestly, there is a lot more than what meets the eye. We live in close harmony with nature. I like to get to know my guests and so if you want to hang out, we can always call in my fun crew and have a chilled evening. Or if you want to chill at home, there can always be some FIFA !","['Identity', 'Email address', 'Phone number']"
