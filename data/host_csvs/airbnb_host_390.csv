In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,
The Beneficent, the Merciful.

Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help.

The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.","['Identity', 'Email address', 'Phone number']"
