Spacious, clean and comfortable. A couple of things I needed, but weren’t right on the night I stayed: no hot water as the geyser was broken (I’d been travelling for 14 hours and needed a hot shower), no top sheet (I don’t want to sleep under just a blanket) and the precise address was late being given to me so I had trouble finding the property. If these details are fixed, I recommend this place",11 years on Airbnb
