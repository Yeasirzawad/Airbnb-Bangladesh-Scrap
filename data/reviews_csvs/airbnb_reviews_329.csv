We checked in Earlier than expected and host was really helpful. Host has been always responsive and offered daily cleaning services. Host also provided all the accessories for cooking.
However, there was a time we had no electricity in the house for few hours and mosquitoes can be bit annoying too.
Overall, it was a great and comfortable stay for our big family!",4 months on Airbnb

The house is very big, the rooms have comfortable beds and the entire apartment has great homely lighting.
Mr.Nizam was very responsive and was super helpful when I wanted extra pillows, blankets etc.
The caretaker Sabbir is also very helpful. I stayed here with my aunt and her full family and they all felt like home. Would definitely recommend booking this place, if you're in Dhaka with a big crew.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
