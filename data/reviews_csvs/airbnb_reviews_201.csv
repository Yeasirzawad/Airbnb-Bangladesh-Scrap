Floor is dirty. Kitchen floor, counter, stove etc never properly clean. Accumulation of dirtiness is everywhere in the kitchen. Bathroom floor and wall needs deep cleaning each time after customers leave. Location is next to dirty lake cause more mosquitoes than other locations. Summer might be real danger for mosquitoes related disease.
Staffs were very nice and owner communicated very promptly.","Bethesda, Maryland"

The house has a excellent location: it is near the main streets but I haven’t feel noisy because of the barrier of the river. Owner of the house responses quickly and for every inquiry and asking for help, he always respond with 5 minutes and solve the problem as soon as possible.
