For a very urgent reason, my partner and I were looking for a place around Banani. Luckily, we found Sohel Aminur’s place at an extremely reasonable rate. The place is fully accessible from all restaurants, pharmacies, and grocery shops. From the very first minute, we experienced a lot of 'awe' due to their tremendous hospitality. They welcomed us with a drink. From toothbrushes to shower gel, they provided every bathroom kit in fresh condition. We can't even think of one thing that was missing from the kitchen cabinet. The way they design these beautiful flats with talented architects truly amazed us.
In summary, it was a 10/10 experience for us, and we feel privileged to have had the chance to stay at this place.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
