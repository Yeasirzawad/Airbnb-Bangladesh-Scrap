The place was spacious especially the dining, kitchen and living room. We stayed in room 3B and my suggestions would be to add a mattress topper for the bed because the bed is not comfortable, and the AC needs to be fixed since it makes quite a noticeable sound. The elevator in the building does not function so that is something to keep in mind, however the staff helped us with my luggage which was very kind of them :)","Ventura, California"
