We had a great time. 7/8 minutes walk from Hotel Inani Beach. The rooms are big and nice. Complimentary breakfast also received on time and good. The towels need a little more attention. It's a great place to stay for some quiet time, with the added bonus of the hotel's swimming pool. The rooms look just like the pictures. If you feel any problem, you tell Borhan and he solves it immediately. Everyone is very good. Thank you","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
