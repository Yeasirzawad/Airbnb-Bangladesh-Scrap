Toilet at the check-in area is unclean, unfinished, and the commode top was broken which can injure people.
Owner didn't provide mat outside toilet, toilet tissue Paper etc. No microwave and restaurant doesn't provide tea before 12pm. Coffee isn't available there at all. Only 1 plate and 1 glass for 2 guests. I wasn't given the apartment I booked. Please avoid 201 (250Sft is too small to be called a studio apartment) or anything on the first (no level 1, G and then, 2,3...) floor and possibly, 2nd floor as too much noises and even, people talking could be heard from the room. Overall, customer service was very poor. However, this is a great and fantastic place (close from airport and very convenient location) to stay if basic/minor changes are made and staffs are trained properly in customer service.",2 years on Airbnb

I had to go into the room again after checkout to show them that the AC remote which was in plain sight. it's better to stay at a hotel than here.",6 years on Airbnb
