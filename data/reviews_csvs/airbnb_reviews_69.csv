He is always up for a discussion over tea and even invited me to visit the neighborhood mosque with him.
The house is conveniently located for everyone looking to stay close to Grameen Bank - a 20 minute walk during which you will pass the Bazaar and national cricket stadium. You will live in a lively but very safe area close to a metro station. However, it may take a while for you to get used to the early morning sounds of the traffic, bazaar, and call to prayer.
The apartment offers all necessities and has a shared terrace with a great city view. It sits on top of a relatively high building without a lift, so it may not be easily accessible for everyone. The bathroom had not been cleaned, so there were lots of spiderwebs. The mattress of the bed was also very hard. Overall, a great host and location for Grameen visitors, but space for improvement on cleanliness and comfort.",5 years on Airbnb

Dhaka’s deficient transport system and chaotic transport makes impossible to choose locations who were not at walking distance to work. The apartment and the company of Roman and all his family could not be better. You have all the facilities of an independent apartment, boosted with an almost private rooftop, but also the familiar ambiance and company just 3 floors downstairs.
Going for the first time to Bangladesh could be difficult and all the travel blogs and trip advisors do not solve many problems or answer many question. Roman is an excellent tutor who will help you solve your daily life problems before your arrival. Communication is very fluid. Ones there you could also arrange to have delicious Bengali food everyday cooked by Shilpi and Nazreen; I can only recommend.
Minor details but that should be considered: there’s a Mosque very close so you will hear Adhan (call to public prayer) every day morning, evening and night. For me it took 1 week to get used…","Quito, Ecuador"

What I can tell other people who have never visited Bangladesh is, Trust the process if you're still unsure about these accommodations. I was first uncertain about what to pack and how much preparation I should have. Before I made this reservation, we had developed excellent communication and had spoken on the phone and via messenger for more than a month. I had problems with the sim card when I first got to Bangladesh, but Roman was kind enough to let me use his phone and willing to solve the problem with me.
I lived in three different countries while growing up and have traveled frequently, and when I visit a new country, it’s significant to have a guardian as much as a comfortable home to stay
in who is knowledgeable about local regions and cultures. Since I don't speak Bengali, his stepdaughters often accompany me whenever I go out. I got to know his daughter well and loved every second of our conversations. He helped me drop me off at the Grameen bank office on the first day and spoke to my supervisor.
Roman’s wife, Shilpi cooks the best Khichuri and Chicken Polao. I still didn’t give up on convincing her to open her restaurant or publish her recipe books. We decided to have lunch together every day because I absolutely love her cooking. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity and the family and friends I met in this country. I did not imagine this level of hospitality and kindness before arriving. I would be happy to speak with anyone who is reading this and is still unsure about this accommodation to clear up any concerns. Again, I want to thank Roman for his dedication and effort to make my stay the best it could be.","New York, New York"

Wonderful stay. Roman was so hospitable from the very beginning. I really liked meeting his family and friends and having meals with him. I also like how he went out of the way to make sure I was safe and accounted for - taking me to the office on the first day. Best host I have ever had- and definitely needed someone like him in a new place like Dhaka. I would recommend this place to anyone who is working at or has an event at Grameen. It is a really easy short walk away and definitely nicer than the accommodations at the Grand Prince.
Some things to note- like someone mentioned before the apartment is on the top floor of a walk- up. Not a problem for me I actually liked the workout but could be a problem for someone else. Also another small issue- the building is in between two mosques and there is usually a loud call to prayer ~5am which can be disruptive to sleep. Not a huge deal but should be noted.","New York, New York"

He guided me taking taxi from airport to his place then accompanied me to my Hotel and gave me a mobile phone with active Sim card for my needs and security that was beyond anyone's expectation.
3 days later I moved in to my reserved place (Roman's Loft). Living for 3 days in a hotel where there is a small room with 4 walls around and missing nature. Upon arriving Roman's Loft which is full of serenity, open sky, botanic environment, multi layered gardens with lots of flowers and trees, a large room with full kitchen facility above all a BOSE surrounding sound system it was great euphoric experience that any western person would love to have after a hectic, traffic jammed and sound polluted day.
During my stay I invited my other Yunus center friends and cooked food for them who were from German, Italy, Austria and Argentina. All my other Grameen Bank friends envied me for such a luxury that they didn't have or I should say they didn't choose to have.
To experience such a person and such a place's charm I am going to experience Roman's other airbnb facility as he has couple of more.
Last but not least, this place is really cool for Grameen Bank/Yonus Centre Interns or any other person who got things to do in Mirpur/Dhaka area.",7 years on Airbnb

There are many things that I loved during my stay. One of them is to eat traditional food of Bangladesh. Roman made Biriyani and Paratha for me and it was very delicious. Also, I loved the family and neighbors who I met in his place. They were very kind and friendly.

He offered a warm welcome on arrival and provided an overall experience similar to that of visiting a relative's home.
That being said, I must be honest in my review to allow future guests have a more realistic expectation for this place.
1) This studio apartment is on the 7th floor (roof add-on) and if you don't want to take the stairs, bring a rope and climb up like Tarzan (there is no elevator).
2) Excellent Bose surround sound system was available - plug-in your media device via Aux headphone jack.
3) Beautifully decorated patio right outside of the apartment provides a 360-degree eagle view of Mirpur (you walked up 7 floors - this is your treat - take it and enjoy it)
4) Even though some of the amenities were listed as available (WiFi, hot water, etc.) you will need to communicate with Roman before your arrival to state exactly which of the amenities you will need during your stay. Wifi was made available the 2nd night because of my lack of communication. Hot water was unavailable both nights of my stay due to out of service water heater. If you need hot water, coordinate with Roman about this beforehand.
5) Mattress - I will not mention exactly what was wrong here on this public post, but I will recommend that you inspect the mattress seams/corners before you lay our body to rest for the night. I informed Roman about the issue and I am confident he will take care of it as his #1 priority.
If you are athletic and fond of a botanical living experience, this place is for you. I strongly recommend you contacting Roman ahead and discussing your needs during the stay. He speaks fluently in English and will go out of his way to help and provide a service beyond what you booked for on airbnb.","New York, New York"

First of all Roman is really caring person, he does everything possible to make sure that one feels comfortable and safe. He welcomed me into his home and I got got to meet the rest of his Family, who are also great.
The flat itself is a single room with en-Suite in the top floor of the house in which Roman and his Family live. It is not luxurious but it is very clean, comfortable and private . One of the really great things about the place is that flat gives out onto a Patio from which there are a further two floors of 'balcony' giving a great view of the area and a place to relax in the evening after a long hot and tiring day in Dhaka.
The area itself is about a 1 hour (2 hours if the traffic is really bad, it is only really about 5km I think but the traffic doesn't really move in Dhaka) bus ride from downtown Dhaka {cost 25 Taka} but is interesting enough in itself and gives you a real feeling of Dhaka. There is a great Bazar on the same road as Roman's house.
I was over for the Bangladesh-England cricket ODI series and one can see the Stadium from the flat. Only a 5-10 Minute walk to the ground.
Really a fantastic experince, I am so glad I Chose to stay with Roman.
If I should visit Dhaka again I would definately want to stay with Roman.","Brig, Switzerland"

Great lengths were taken to ensure a pleasant environment with modern amenities that cater to short and long term travelers alike. I felt incredibly welcome by the thoughtful host and his family, who live just a few floors below and are only a call away. The building itself is located within walking distance of several restaurants, variety shops, bazars and cafes; those who prefer to cook their own meals will find a fully-equipped kitchen area. Getting around the city is easily accessible via a transportation hub just a few blocks away; and Mahinur can provide directions and advice, if needed.

The gem, I'd say, of the place is the 360° panoramic view of the lively Mirpur Thana (borough) from the uppermost terrace complete with seating area and a garden. If you're looking to experience Dhaka life in a local neighborhood, look no further! I extended my stay well beyond my initial dates, as I found it difficult to part with the place - and the city.
