It is secluded, secure and accessible location with a friendly atmosphere and neighborhood.. This place was very homely and i cooked food without any hesitation. There is CSD canteen, grocery store, lake and a garden just in 4 minutes walk. Also, you will get bikes, autos for travel at 4 mins walk nearby ananya super shop. Uber/pathao accessible.
The host (Shuman) was very proactive and responsive. He was very friendly and nice to talk with. There were minor concerns and he took care of it immediately. Whenever, I come back , I would love to stay at his place.
Thank you so much for hosting us.
If you are family person and love to be by yourself and enjoy the nature, this is your place….","Sacramento, California"

Most Airbnb's around that area are overpriced and under-stocked. Shuman's place had everything we needed, was right next to a nice dokan, and Shuman was very responsive and engaged. He even accommodated our early check in request. We'd definitely stay here again next time we are in Dhaka!","Rajshahi, Bangladesh"

""We had an amazing stay at Shuman place! The apartment was exactly as described - clean, cozy, and in a fantastic location. The check-in process was seamless, and Shuman was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. The place was stocked with all the essentials and more, making us feel right at home. The neighborhood was quiet and safe, with plenty of great restaurants and cafes within walking distance. We would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Dhaka and would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Shuman for a wonderful stay!","New York, New York"

The flat is exactly as described in the listing and photos. The flat is also so clean and has all the amenities needed to do some cooking. We especially like the washing machine!

Other airbnb flats in this specific area that we've stayed at have not been very high quality, so we feel like Shumon's place was exactly what we were looking for. Clean and with all the amenities needed for our few days' stay (especially kitchen utensils, something we have found sorely lacking in Bangladesh airbnbs). Shumon was also very responsive and proactive in his communication. We felt very welcomed and comfortable our entire stay. Comfortable beds, hot water for showers, perfect location, close to the park and grocery store, washing machine, everything you could want! We would highly recommend you stay at Shumon's place!","Hamtramck, Michigan"
