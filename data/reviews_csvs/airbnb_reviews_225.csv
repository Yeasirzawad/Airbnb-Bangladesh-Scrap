The both party is unfortunate of the situation we have been faced that day. There had been a murder and there were police everywhere.
But the problem us host didn’t clear the situation. He kept me waiting for 4 hours outside and kept telling me to wait for few more minutes. That’s where everything gone wrong.
We were informed at 10:00 pm that we couldn’t check in and it was already late for us to shift our plan to anywhere.
I asked them to move me any other place as they have some other properties too but they didn’t help me at any cost.
Although they were really fast to response but I would ask for more professionalism from them.",10 months on Airbnb
