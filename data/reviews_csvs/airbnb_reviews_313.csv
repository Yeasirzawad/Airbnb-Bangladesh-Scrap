We came from Siliguri and were looking for a place to stay the night before driving back to Kolkata. The guesthouse exceeded our expectations: it was clean, beautifully decorated with plants and greenery all around and the caretaker was an extremely sweet and helpful guy.
The thali we ordered was definitely worth the wait: freshly made, good quantity and it included delicious chutney and some salad. The property is dog friendly and I would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling with a pet. Follow the directions of the host, as the place is hard to find if you use only Google maps.
I would recommend to stay one more night, to explore the activities they offer and to just relax in the green oasis before heading back to Kolkata. Best stop between Siliguri and Kolkata! Recommend!",4 years on Airbnb

The property is full of plants, it's basically one big garden maintained by the owner. Our two dogs loved that aspect of it. The room is basic - most of the space is taken up by the bed. The night we stayed was quit cold but the blankets were sufficient for us to stay warm. Also, the caretaker was able to provide us with additional things that we needed like a kettle, extra blankets, and Goodnight for mosquitos.
We opted for the homemade dinner option which was prepared by the host's wife. The food was delicious and I would highly recommend it if you enjoy authentic Bengali food. However, after a long day of driving and not eating on the road because we thought dinner would be ready soon after we reached, the 3 hour wait was a bit hard for us - we had an early morning the next day and ended up staying awake to eat only. Apart from this one thing (which can be improved), I would recommend this Airbnb as an affordable pet-friendly option.",7 years on Airbnb

If you are trying to break journey and travelling with your pet the property is perfect. Look no further. Malda like all North Bengal towns with its traffic and crowds can get on your nerves but once inside its serene , peaceful and secluded. There are two lawns and the property is walled and basic. The host is a ""bangali bhodrolok"" - elite and gentleman. The caretaker a simpleton. Had a great break for the night. Will certainly stayover again.",6 years on Airbnb

The caretaker's behaviour was annoying. Bathroom was not clean when we reached, and the host got it cleaned. The garden is good but the rooms are not worth what we paid for. There are star hotels nearby for the same price. Except that it's pet friendly. caretaker stays in the next room, no privacy. Food was not good too. Host was communicative and tried to rectify the issues but the caretaker's behaviour was unpleasant.
Our whole day went bad because of the argument with the caretaker early in the morning.
