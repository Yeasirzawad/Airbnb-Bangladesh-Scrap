The space itself is large and wifi is good, but maintenance is not very good (things are broken and taped together) and we had to ask for basic things like sponges, soap, dish towels, and cleaning supplies since we were staying for a month. Luckily the host was responsive and apologetic, and got most of what we asked for within a week. The location is good and safe, but I likely wouldn’t stay again until the apartment is properly fixed up.","Toronto, Canada"

Every little detail is perfectly thought out and the space couldn’t be more perfect. This is a new, clean, and beautiful flat, and very much lives up to the photos. Mushfeq was a fantastic host! He is very kind, prompt and helped us with every aspect of our reservation and stay. The attention the owner gave us made us feel so special. We highly recommend this place. Would definitely book again. Thank you Mushfeq.","Cincinnati, Ohio"
