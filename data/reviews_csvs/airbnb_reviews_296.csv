The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The neighbourhood is very conveniently located and although it’s a lively neighbourhood the apartment is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend staying there!The thing I like most the hospitality and prompt service of great food deals through food delivery app in very close proximity of the neighborhood .,3 years on Airbnb

We enjoyed our stay at his conveniently located flat by the lakeside. I was familiar with the neighborhood and for our needs the location was excellent, with lots of local restaurants nearby. There are also some nice cafes on Rd 2 nearby, but that wasn't quite apparent at the beginning. Syed was also very accommodative with our late check out needs and made it very convenient. The boardwalk along the lakeside gives you a convenient way to walk and stay active. Overall we had a good stay and I would recommend this to people who are looking to stay in this part of town. Beyond the flat and the host, Dhaka city is quite chaotic and its traffic congestion, pollution and noise level are not for the faint of heart. Crossing roads without proper crosswalks and working traffic lights can be very challenging for the uninitiated, but as a former local I was able to navigate through it ok.","Vancouver, Canada"
