Everyone was pretty friendly and helpful whenever we needed something. The location is convenient for shopping and city travelling and was still holding the old Dhanmondi vibes with privacy. Spacious rooms with beautifully decorated arts were not only cozy but also depicts the beautiful minds of the owners. We stayed as family with kids and never felt like we were away from home! Will stay again in future if God willing.,"Whitehall, Pennsylvania"
