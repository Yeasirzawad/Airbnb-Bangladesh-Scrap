1. The location is nice but the Entrance of the building is very very bad. There's a constraction going on maybe after that it'll be little smooth.
2. The Paid Parking the host said 100/- per night but the owner of the parking said it's 150/- per night & also they charged 50/- extra for baseless excuses. The behaviour of parking owner is Very rude. There's a miscommunication going on between the Host & the Owner of the Parking which needs to sort it out so that we don't have to unnecessarily argue with them even the caretakers couldn't do anything about it.
3. Although the house looks as it is in the picture, the behaviour of the caretaker is very nice & co-operative but they need to maintain the house more. Bathrooms isn't clean, the rooms are Little messy, 2 AC isn't working
4. The lock of the main door isn't working, it's a major security issue which the host is not aware of it. The caretaker should've told the host",1 month on Airbnb
