Pros-
-Located in Gulshan
-very clean
-there is a common kitchen with all the utensils
-They even had TV, Oven, Washing machine and what not
Cons-
-The room does not have an attached bathroom.The bathroom is just outside the room but you have to step out. It will be better if this is mentioned in the description just to avoid any last minute confusion.
-There was no socket in the room to charge a phone or a laptop or anything.When i pointed this out to the caretaker Alamin khan,he gave me a multiplug and then i had no issues but ofcourse this could be improved
-The bed mattress is really really hard.I got accustomed to it in a day but it would be great if this is changed.
Rest all was good and i enjoyed my stay here.",2 years on Airbnb
