The apartment itself is cozy and clean, with plenty of spaces for storage, and I can say I will be a happy return customer.

The purpose of my travel was to get married, and Mr. Mamunur made sure I enjoyed my entire time there without any restriction. I informed the host that some guests would arrive to meet me(not to stay at night), and Mr. Mamunur was okay with that. I made sure there wouldn't be any noise for other people in the building from my end. Mr. Mamunur was so understandable and cooperative.
Location and security are fantastic. There are several parks near the apartment where I went for a walk in the evening, masques near, and two CSD grocery shops near the apartment.

House itself has two bedrooms, and the master bedroom has an air conditioner, and the other room doesn't. Clean, and all necessary items were available at the apartment.
We broke two small crockeries from the kitchen, and I informed Mrs. Mamunur, and she said no worries about that. So I didn't want to the left without telling them about that damage we made. My mom said to clean as much we could before we checkout. So my wife and I cleaned as highest as possible before we left the apartment. I and wifey love my entire renting time, and we will love to rent back again.
Again, I want to say thank you to the host(Mr. Mamunur) on behalf of my family members for giving us such a fantastic first-time Airbnb experience.","New York, United States"
