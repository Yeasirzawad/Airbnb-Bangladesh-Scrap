The washing machine was a great asset. Worth noting its location is quite close to a busy road which is convenient for access but does mean there is some noise.

We loved the location of the building as it’s in an upscale neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shopping areas only few minutes of walking distance. The security in the building is the best I’ve seen in any place in Dhaka.
As for the house, the layout of the house is very nice with lots of paintings with lots of spaces. The house was very clean with clean bathrooms and hot showers. There are air conditions in the living room and the 2 bedrooms. There is a big screen TV with Netflix and YouTube app thats great for entertainment. The kitchen is very nice with a brand new microwave. There is a house cleaner that comes in every day and cleans the entire place. Internet was pretty good as I had to work from home. Ms. Nahid is a great host and if I asked for anything, she didn’t hesitate. Mr. Rafiq was also amazing. Highly recommended and I will definitely stay here the next time I’m back in Dhaka","New York, United States"
