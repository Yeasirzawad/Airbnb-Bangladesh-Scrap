Always accessible and helpful. The place is at the end of a street , so relatively quiet. Bed was comfortable. Check-in process was easy and hussle-free. Daily cleaning service is a bonus.
Only couple of issues, if you use a car, the parking is very difficult. If you dont need to park, no issues. The other thing is - the house needs some maintenance. We experienced some water leakages in two rooms after heavy rain and clogged water in the master bath. We have notified Sajib,. he said he would look into that.
Overall, we were happy with the stay and happy to return here.",7 years on Airbnb

Apartment was spacious and true to photos. Just thought that more towels should have been provided and towels and bed linen did smell a bit musty and a little bit of a general clean and dust would leave this a great 5 star air bnb.

You have all the freedom to be here and comfort guaranteed. Security is helpful and daily staff will clean the house as promised without fail.
Minus is finding the place. Very hard to locate the apartment. But once you find, easy to describe to drivers. Foodpanda has difficulty to locate the house.
Electricity gets cut constantly and tts y minus one star. But its common in Bangladesh. When electricity is cut, generator gets active but operates certain devices only. So there will be no wifi. Better to have sim card from airport. Fortunately i have electricity problem only on the first and second day. After that was fine.
Staffs are great and friendly. They secure our belongings and provide great assist to keep the house clean. Non banglas have translation app as they are not well versed in English.",9 years on Airbnb

First and foremost, the communication with Sajib Bhai was outstanding. He was prompt, responsive, and provided clear instructions on how to reach the property.
Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by Sajib Bhai's caretaker and given a tour of the place. The accommodation was clean, well-maintained, and beautifully decorated. It felt like a home away from home, with all the necessary amenities provided (apart from the dental Kit). However, during my stay, Sajib Bhai went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed.
I highly recommend Sajib Bhai's Airbnb to anyone looking for a pleasant and seamless stay. The combination of a fantastic host, comfortable accommodations, and a great location made my trip truly memorable. I would gladly book this place again in the future and encourage others to do the same.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
