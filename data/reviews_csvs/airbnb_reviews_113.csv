Plenty of eateries and shopping around the place. A mega Aarong handicrafts store is nearby.
The apartment itself was huge - frankly, it was too large for just one person! The big TV on the wall was great - especially for the football. Sofas in the living were large and very comfy. The apartment was very clean, the air-conditioning was perfect. Kitchen was well-stocked with pots and pans. The shower in the main bathroom worked perfectly, with running hot water. The bed and pillows weren't as comfy as one might expect.
Finally, Toufiqur, the manager was extremely helpful at check-in. Farooq the caretaker was always there to help out (including opening the gate late at night!)",8 years on Airbnb
