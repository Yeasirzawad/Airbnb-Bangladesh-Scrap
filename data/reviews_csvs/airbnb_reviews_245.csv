The location of the place is very convenient for me. The apartment is large and can easily accommodate a family of 6 persons. Each and every amenities available were very useful but a water filter would have made life easier. I would like to request the host to consider it since I have plans to visit again.
The location is great and convenient for commuters. There are various restaurants and food options available nearby. Considering everything I would love to recommend this place to others.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"

Check in was smooth and easy as was check out. The building is quiet and secure. The apartment itself was lacking of basic amenities. We got two towels in total for 4 guests for the entire span of our stay which was 14 days. Apartment was neat and decluttered but by no means was it cleaned before we checked in.,"New York, New York"

His representative was consistently available over phone or in person whenever we needed assistance. The security guards of the building were also very helpful at all times. The location is highly central, with KFC, Pizza Hut, Origin of Tehri Ghor, and numerous other restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk or a 2-minute rickshaw or car ride. Satmosjid Road is also very close by where there are around 50 different classic buffet restaurants and many other famous shops. We enjoyed our morning walks around Dhanmondi Lake, and the apartment offers a splendid view of Dhaka from the top-level floor. All rooms are equipped with air conditioners, and the amenities provided were ample for our needs. During our three-week stay from overseas, the apartment truly felt like our home, and we eagerly anticipate staying again.",7 years on Airbnb

The apartment is mewly renovated with brand new appliances. The manager, Mr. Sohel Rana, is very humble and friendly. He took care of anything that we needed. Overall a 5 star experience.","Leesburg, Virginia"
