I loved the communications that Minhazul had and professionalism as well. As for the hiccups it is Bangladesh so it was expected. Only thing that we did have a slight issue with was when we checked in, the place was not cleaned properly (kitchen and bathroom) as there were dusts and hair all over. But upon request, Minhazul sent the cleaning staff to re'clean per our liking. We also extended our stay for another 10 days without an issue. Thank Minhazul and Alamin!",11 months on Airbnb
