The place located outskirt of Dhaka however the entire area and place is amazing. If you looking for private space and silent environment then this is the place and host is really helpful. I would definitely recommend this place.,7 years on Airbnb

The location is very convenient and beautiful. It is secluded from the hustle and bustle of Dhaka. The design of the Villa is very unique as well. You will also love the hospitality of the host. All and all a brilliant experience. I will definitely come back.,"Dhaka Division, Bangladesh"
