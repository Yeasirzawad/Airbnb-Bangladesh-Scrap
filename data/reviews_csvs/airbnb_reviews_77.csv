Convenient to find, hassle free check in since there was no formality to be filled up, well cleaned and maintained room and bathroom, very helpful people.
However, there were few issues which need to be addressed by the hosts. Firstly, the Wifi is very very slow, not even allowing proper WA calls, leave aside video calls or video streaming. While it was unfortunate that there was some nationwide internet issue due to some deep sea cable fault, but this was resolved within first 2 days, since I could use good wifi in other places from the 3rd day but not in this place. Secondly, guests inside the room will not know when the ladies come in the morning to clean the place. In the entire 5 nights stay, my room was cleaned and the linen were changed only for 1 day, that also after i informed the gatekeeper to call me the next day morning when the lady comes. Otherwise, they are not bothered even to knock and ask whether the room needs to be cleaned.",2 years on Airbnb
