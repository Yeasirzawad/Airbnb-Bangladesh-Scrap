As he is not present so he explained everything properly through text. Check in was easy just needed to call the caretaker in advance to get an exact location where to get off from your transport to reach the location comfortably. The caretaker Arif was always a phone call away. Only thing I missed was there were only two pillows as we were two people we need two more but didn’t asked the caretaker for anything coz we left the same day as we had to a flight to catch. It’s a beautiful cozy small apartment which is very good for two people. There’s lot of restaurants in walking distance. I would love to stay once again for sure.,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"
