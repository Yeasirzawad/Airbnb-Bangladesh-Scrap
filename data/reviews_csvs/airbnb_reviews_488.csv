The Nest Coffee Lounge is downstairs in same building so one can order breakfast/lunch/dinner from there as they prepare well at a reasonable charge. It is a college/student area, so you have many tea/snacks outlet nearby.
The place is a perfect example of ""studio apartment""-very compact and well designed(around 250 Sq Ft).The tv has tata sky so one can use it in free time.
The only issue is mosquitoes which is a part of this location/surroundings so never open the windows/doors post evening as that is hazardous/painful which I realized after my 1st night because i had kept the windows and balcony door open for cool air!!
The place is around 20 kms from Bagdogra airport and clearly shows on map/Uber/Ola so no worries at all.",6 years on Airbnb
