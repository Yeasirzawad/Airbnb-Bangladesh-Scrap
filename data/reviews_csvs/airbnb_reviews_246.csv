Great location, by the famous “Dhanmondi lake”. Communication was good. However, it’s not a “luxurious apartment” as it says in the title. It’s an old apartment and needs improvement in many areas. Bathroom needs simply an overhaul. There were broken faucets, lots of stains in the bathroom. Probably there is a geyser in one of the bathrooms but hot water didn’t come even after waiting for long time. One of the bathrooms was locked, it was opened but it was very dirty. Electrical ports and sockets are old. Bedrooms were okay but closets were dusty. Blankets were not washed. ACs were working and good. Didn’t use kitchen that much but it could have better cleaned. There was filter water supply (appreciated). Check-in/check-out was easy, apartment building stuffs were friendly. Elevator worked fine. Connecting to Wi-fi was confusing - it worked eventually though. Mosquito net was available in one of bedrooms. Overall it was an okay stay.",7 years on Airbnb

Mr. Moinul Islam was a very friendly and great person. He took care of our every need. He and his associates make me feel I’m staying in my home. The location was great. Just bedside the Dhanmmondi lake. It’s a peaceful place to stay with my family. I stayed 2 weeks with my family and I will highly recommend anyone with a small family to stay and spend relaxed and quality time in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Greatly appreciate their hospitality. Surely I will be happy to stay at this apartment on my upcoming travel to Bangladesh following year’s. And I will highly recommend others to stay at this place.","Allen, Texas"
