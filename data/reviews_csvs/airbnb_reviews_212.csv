The location is not correctly advertise- Why do not mention the lane by the sides of SAPTADINGA RESTAURENT, life will be easy, they have very big red color neon sign which is visible from atleast 500 meters. The manager Mr. Alamgir and the sweet lady Ms. Dalia are 100% positive attitude and very helpful. Lastly if I do not mention again about Mr. Mir. A very gentle and polite boy with well behaved. I love his "" Bhyiya"" word. See you again Mr. Mir.",3 years on Airbnb

The refrigerator is very small comparing three bed apartment. The Wi-Fi is very slow, near to joke. The apartment from the neighboring building next to master bedroom is very loud up-to 4 in the morning I think some college students messing there. The owner Mr.Mir Is very responsive and helpful. I recommend it to the people who like very crowded neighborhoods.",8 years on Airbnb
