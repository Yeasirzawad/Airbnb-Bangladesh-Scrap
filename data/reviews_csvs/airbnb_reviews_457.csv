Michelle was incredibly accommodating, allowing me to check in late and providing clear instructions for a seamless arrival. The space itself was cozy and clean, with all the amenities I required for a comfortable night's rest. The location was conveniently close to the airport, making it easy to reach without any hassle. I highly recommend this for anyone in need of a convenient stopover spot.

In our brief time at their stay their hospitality has truly stood out for us, the complimetary breakfast and the care with which it was served, is truly a blend of homely and quality service. The space was cozy, very clean, with all necessary amenities, their attention to detail stood out, they had printouts for all info that will make your stay smooth and hassel free, from instructions to help with getting takeout food delivered to cab services.
Their warmth truly added to our experience of Siliguri. We would definitely recommend their Bed and Breakfast. And for Michelle and her family a heartfelt gratitude from me and my Crew.",7 years on Airbnb
