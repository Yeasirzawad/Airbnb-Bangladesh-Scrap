The owner, Rajdeep is very hospitable. And even the Host, Sunny is very friendly and hospitable. and even the service boys were nice. The rooms were clean and even the bathroom is clean. There is a shared kichen where we can cook our own meal using any utensils available in the kichen and we have to clean the utensils being used.. We stayed for two weeks and it was a great stay.. Since we are girls, the place was quite Comfortable and felt very safe. Travelling to other part of Siliguri was quite convenient as autos and tuk tuks are easily available right from the gate.
Would love to stay again if I ever have to go to Siliguri again.",1 month on Airbnb
