It was my favorite Airbnb experience so far! We really enjoyed the hospitality and being along with the friends of Robi and his brother Ali respectively. They showed us around the area: the place is in a village close to Chittagong, with a nice atmosphere, 15 min. walk to the riverside and a bit more walk to the seaside (Patenga Sea Beach). Porapara Art Space is an interesting project, supporting art, motivating the people in Bangladesh to get in touch with art and see the value of it. I recommend to stay at least 3 days/nights to enjoy the hospitality and interesting talks/activites!",9 years on Airbnb
