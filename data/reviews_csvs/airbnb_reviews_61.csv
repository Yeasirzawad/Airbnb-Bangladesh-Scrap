Apu and her husband both were very helpful. Check in was easy. Everything was super clean. Their furniture choice is great which makes the place look awesome. The kitchen had everything, we even cooked. The living room had a comfortable space, we hanged out and watched tv.
Everything was great. I highly recommend this place. Definitely would be my first choise if I am around town and wanna visit again. 🤘🏻🤘🏻",2 years on Airbnb

She & her husband were very much responsive from booking the place to recieving us and through out the checkin and checkout time. The entire flat is furnished and amenities are perfectly available. The kitchens and washrooms were equipped with necessary items need for cooking or taking shower. Has two separate balconies to spend time alone and smoke. It’s a quite place to have some me time. Very much recommended and looking forward to stay again. Thank you very much to both Nafisa Apu & her husband. Love 🧡,"Dhaka, Bangladesh"
