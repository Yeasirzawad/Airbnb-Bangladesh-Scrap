The staff working in the house, Momena and Jahanara, were extremely kind and helpful. They all made sure I felt comfortable and that I had everything I needed.
The apartment is in one of the best locations in Dhaka, a very calm neighbourhood close to shops, restaurants and cafés. The apartment was clean, the kitchen was well equipped and the room had its private bathroom, which I appreciated.
It wasn't clear from the description that the room was in Faruq's house and that I would be the only guest, but I didn't mind it. I wouldn't recommend the apartment if you mind the smell of cigarettes, but Faruq was respectful about it.
It was a great stay overall, and I felt welcomed and comfortable at Faruq's house.","Montreal, Canada"

We couldn’t of wished for a better place in Gulshan for the price we paid. We will be staying here again!
Thanks Faruq.",6 years on Airbnb
