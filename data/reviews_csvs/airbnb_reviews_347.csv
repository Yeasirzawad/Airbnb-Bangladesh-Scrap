You can easily reach here from station. Host was very co operative and you can relay on every suggestion they provide , for fooding, for travelling, etc.
Place was good for single, family or friend group. Ferry ghat was also near, toto takes 10 rs. You can stay as long as( until last ferry), you wish at mayapur with giving prior information to security guard who was also very co operative. Home delivery was also available from nearest hotel nilima.
I would suggest , everyone to stay here , if they visit nabadwip , mayapur.",6 years on Airbnb
