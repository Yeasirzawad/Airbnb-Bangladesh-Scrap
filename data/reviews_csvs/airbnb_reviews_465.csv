Upon arriving we found the apartment to be spacious, tidy, and clutter-free. Although we stayed during the warm season, the interior was cool during the day and the night. Apart from one minimal description, the apartment matched the advert. Only one room had air conditioning but this didn't matter.
The location was close to restaurants, shops, and the airport but tucked away enough to be quiet and peaceful. The overall stay in Ali's apartment was great, and I would certainly stay again. The management team was very helpful and very quick to respond. Everyone spoke very good English.
Thank you Ali and the team.",1 year on Airbnb
