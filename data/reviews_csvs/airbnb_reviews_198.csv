Staying here was safe, comfortable and convenient - especially for a solo woman. Through staying here I also learnt about a female-led travel community in Bangladesh - Travelettes of Bangladesh - as the apartment operates as an informal HQ for the group.
The room, with two simple mattresses on the floor, doubles as a common space by day. In the spirit of offering safe, affordable accommodation for women visiting Dhaka you may share the room with other guests - on one night I shared the room with 2 women travelling to the city for medical and work interviews. Although the place is shared by many, there is lots of space to relax, do everyday things like washing clothes or cooking, even a desk for work. It's also in a perfect location from which to explore Dhaka, with the cultural centre Dhanmondhi nearby, and transport options plentiful.
Thank you Sakia and Travelettes of Bangladesh for the great hospitality. I look forward to staying again in the future.",12 years on Airbnb
