The house is exceptionally nice, clean, and equipped with all the western amenities you can imagine, making it feel like I never left my home in the USA. Syd is incredibly responsive, addressing all my questions and requests within hours despite the time difference. His attentiveness and efficiency made my stay even more comfortable. I highly recommend Syd's place, especially for travelers who appreciate the convenience of being close to everything in Dhaka, while enjoying a neat and clean environment with all the necessary amenities. This is the only house I know that not only has a washer but also a dryer, so you don’t have to worry about hanging clothes on the balcony or roof. Additionally, there is a dishwasher for your dirty dishes, which is a plus for western travelers.","North Springfield, Virginia"
