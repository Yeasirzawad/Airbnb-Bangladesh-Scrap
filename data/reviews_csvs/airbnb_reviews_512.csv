Basic things like mirror, geyser may be provided for guest(s). Breakfast was delicious but timing of breakfast is fixed i.e. 9 to 9:30 AM. If timing of breakfast was flexible, we would have to be very happy. Because of the breakfast timing we couldn't leave the room on our desired time.
By the way, this review is being written to improve basic things according to guest. Otherwise overall experience was good for us.",9 months on Airbnb
