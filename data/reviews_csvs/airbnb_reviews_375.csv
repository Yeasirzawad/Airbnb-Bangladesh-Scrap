This is a sweet spot in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by a river and a little village. With a big garden and serviceminded staff, it made our stay so good. They serve wonderful, homemade food. We had a guide who took is into to jungle, and we also got to swim at a quiet spot (fare from curious people) at the beach.",9 years on Airbnb
