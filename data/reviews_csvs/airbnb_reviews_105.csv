I arrived with little notice. Tariq was very helpful and handled any issues quick and professionally.
The place is as described and the pictures are accurate. The caretaker was also very helpful, often bringing breakfast.
I would happily make this place my home if possible.
Thank You Tariq!","Rock Hill, South Carolina"
