The property was clean, spacious, and filled with natural light, offering a pleasant experience. The host was exceptionally helpful, even assisting me in resolving an issue with the keys in the midnight promptly.
However, some basic amenities like towels, toothbrushes, and drinking water were missing. While I understand the limitations of a residential building, it would have been helpful if these were mentioned in the description to prepare accordingly. Despite these areas of improvement, I would recommend this place for its overall positive experience.",India

Soon it was found that the apartment caught electrical fire from faulty wiring. We were terrified as hell. Owner came and mentioned that luckily the electric circuit was auto tuned off, otherwise we could be in serious danger. He took us to a nearby hotel but I had to pay for it. We remained at the hotel for two nights due to his electrical service and maintenance. Although owner said he will refund the lost nights but later refused to reimburse the whole. He offered to reimburse one full night and partially another night. No clue what made him to decide like this. We survived a terrible house fire due to faulty electrical systems, negligence of the owner, lack of instructions about dangerous situations inside the apartment. It is shocking, it was a close call.",4 months on Airbnb

Other than that, the place was well decorated and organised.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
