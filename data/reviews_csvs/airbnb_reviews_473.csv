The house and room were beautifully decorated and very comfortable.

Well maintained and we loved it. It is very close to Bagdogra airport which is another plus point. The caretaker Barsha is extremely polite and helpful. We stayed one night only.

My father is an elderly man for whom this break in travel was important and necessary, and I first found this place when I thought I did not want to put him through a gruelling travel routine.

And so I asked Daljit to stay in their villa, as the photographs looked most charming. I must admit, it was more charming and lovely in real life! Daljit and Minna went absolutely out of their way to make sure my father and I were looked after, in fact, making us feel like old family friends. Both of them, and Blues their little spaniel, are excellent company, sharing with us their stories as we did ours. We were given the esteem and regard that we usually reserve for those we know personally -- something that only very generous hosts can do. And for this I am most grateful.

Their place helps stagger your travel if you want to rest, and if you want to figure out some know-how about things to do. The hosts are also wonderful in helping with ways of organising transport, telling you about things to do, though I feel we troubled them too much!

Thanks again, for a lovely few days -- which were as nice as our time in the mountains!",11 years on Airbnb
