The apartment was spacious, clean, and well-equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The location was also perfect - close to public transportation, restaurants, and shops.
The host, Md Ashraful, was incredibly welcoming and helpful. He went above and beyond to make sure I had a great stay, providing me with recommendations for local activities and restaurants. He was also very responsive to my messages and questions.
I would highly recommend Zozu's Nest@Uttara-18 to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Dhaka.",United Kingdom

The only limitation is there is no shop nearby as this is a residential area.","Dayton, Ohio"

The apartment was modern, clean, and tidy matching the description and the photos. It is inside a large residential area providing peaceful living. Hence, shopping centres and restaurants are outside; I was initially doubtful about getting Ubers to move around, but didn't face difficulty at the end. Mosquitoes were an issue (can be an issue anywhere in Dhaka too), but the good thing is that there are mosquito nets in all of the bedrooms. and we used our own aerosol spray. Even though some people drink tap water directly in this area, we preferred to buy mineral water from outside; there are options to boil tap water (kettle and stove) inside the apartment if one prefers. There are good cooking facilities inside, and we cooked our own meals. Overall, we enjoyed living and will never hesitate to come again.",7 years on Airbnb
