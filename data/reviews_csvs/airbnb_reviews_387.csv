With his many apartments around Dhaka, he is super helpful when things are needed. 2 things to notice: the area of this house is really quiet hence the gates close at 11-12 pm and will have to wake up the caretaker at night to open the main gate downstairs. Also the location on the map in Airbnb is a bit off I have mentioned this to the host, and in order to get an accurate idea of the location it’s best to check yourself in google. Overall a good stay with Saleh specially for the price.","Toronto, Canada"
