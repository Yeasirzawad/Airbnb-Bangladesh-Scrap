Both apartments are great and comfortable, and Dipto is always happy to help. I particularly enjoy the Baridhara location, as it's a bit easier to get around for groceries or just for a walk around the park. Robin, Shaila and Dipto are all super nice, kind, available and flexible, and I'm happy to now call them friends. Looking forward to my next stay in Dhaka with them :)","Montreal, Canada"
