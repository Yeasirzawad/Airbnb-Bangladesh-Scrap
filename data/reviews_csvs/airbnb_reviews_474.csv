My stay at Mriganka's home in Siliguri was delightful. The spacious, immaculate room offered a comfortable retreat, conveniently located near Hill Cart Road and the bustling Hong Kong Market. While the absence of soap in the bathroom was a minor inconvenience, the hot shower was a welcome luxury. Caesar, the friendly dog, added to the homely atmosphere.
However, what truly made my stay memorable was the genuine hospitality of Mriganka's parents. From the moment of arrival, they welcomed me warmly, treating me like family. Their generosity extended to preparing a hearty breakfast before my departure.
In conclusion, my stay at Mriganka's home was a perfect blend of comfort, convenience, and heartfelt hospitality. Siliguri holds a special place in my heart now, thanks to this memorable experience.",3 years on Airbnb
