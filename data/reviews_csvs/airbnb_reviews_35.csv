We were looking to get out of the city and into a more slow-paced, down to earth location. This was perfect! We were picked up at the airport and rode in a car about 40 minutes to the farmstead. We were greeted with an incredibly warm welcome. The room was large and had two double beds with plenty of room for our pack-n-play. Hot showers and a towel was provided. The hosts were gracious enough to open their kitchen and dining room to us. Home cooked meals were provided 3 times a day and they were delicious! James and his family assisted us in renting a ""van"" (flatbed pulled by motorized bicycle) to go explore the nearby market. Aloshikha is an absolutely amazing campus caring for a significant number of children in their on-campus orphanage, school, and hospital. We enjoyed playing games and spending time with the kids. The farmstead also had a variety of animals for our young boys to feed and play with, which they loved! We learned about the rice paddies on campus and how to grow and care for the rice plants, a unique experience! We also had the opportunity to watch the family cook on a mud stove...amazing! The sweet wife of James even baked our 4 year old a cake for his birthday! We have only compliments to give this wonderful host and airbnb! We will definitely be returning again and again!","Aurora, Colorado"
