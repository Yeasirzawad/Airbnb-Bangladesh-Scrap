The Jatra in Khulna was superb, this was not. The room needed a proper clean with lots of dust/detritus in the places you can’t see immediately, an old toothbrush behind the basin and some of the power points didn’t work. Mattress edge broken as so many guests had sat on the side of bed. Tried one breakfast and ate out for second. Good location for buses to and from Dhaka, and felt safe. Hard to find at night - look for Muntasir centre not Jatra",11 years on Airbnb

Rooms are tiny but clean and organized. A little noisy since it is right on a busy highway and flyover. But if you ask they will try to give you something quite and relaxing. Staffs are very friendly and helpful! Will definitely stay here again!,"Garden City, New York"
