The host allowed me late check-out (3pm) since it was not booked for that day. Hot water was provided upon request.
Pros: Spacious apartment, secured, regular cleaning (you have to ask), both ACs worked perfectly (one was a bit noisy).
Cons: No toiletries were provided (host asked me to bring own toiletries before check-in though), bedsheets were quite old and low quality, refrigerator and oven were also very old. Under construction building is not a super comfortable place to live.
Suggestions to the host: Please provide a TV which is a basic thing that every place should have (I took it obvious and did not notice that you don't have it in your description).",5 years on Airbnb
