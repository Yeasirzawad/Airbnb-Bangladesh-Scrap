Booking was very easy and host communicated well. The place was as described and photos look the same.
it has working good water filter, so no need to worry about clean drinking water. Full working kitchen and washing machine.
lift is very good. Rooms are very clean and tidy.
it's not very far from big private hospital at Dhanmondi like LabAid, Popular etc.
Locally restaurants available, whom you can contact and they can deliver warm food.
Aircon working well and when you close the windows it becomes so peaceful and almost no noise came from outside.
Hot water, Microwave & Freeze worked well.
it has CCTV outside the door and downstairs and 24/7 guards and caretaker available. So no problem with security at all.
I recommend this place to all. Hope you will also have a nice time here.",4 months on Airbnb
