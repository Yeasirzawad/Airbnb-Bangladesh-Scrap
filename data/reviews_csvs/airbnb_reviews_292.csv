They were very proactive and easy to talk to, going out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Dipto and Alamin are very kind and helpful, always doing everything so that we were comfortable in the apartment.
The rooms were spacious and well decorated, and the bathrooms were clean. The living room and dining areas are huge, and I always felt comfortable using the shared spaces in the apartment. The kitchen is small but functional. It has a lot of storage and is furnished with the equipment required to cook. They provided filtered water, which was appreciated.
The apartment is well located, a walking distance from cafés, restaurants, and grocery stores. The neighbourhood feels safe and is quiet in the evening.
Robin and Shaila have other apartments which are also very nice. I would definitely recommend for both short and long stays in Dhaka, and I will for sure stay with them again the next time I am in Dhaka","Montreal, Canada"

The bathroom was bigger than expected. The host is very professional and friendly, he provided everything before asking. The caretaker was very polite and helped us with all our needs. He prepared the room very nicely, turned the AC on before we entered the property. It was so relaxing to enter in a cold room in this heat. It was my last night in bd and everything went so well and smoothly. The location of the place is also really good as it was close to all the banani restaurants and very convenient to move from one place to another. I highly recommend to book any places with this host as the way he maintains his properties is a lot different than any other hosts in Bangladesh.",3 years on Airbnb

I prefer to stay here even for my future stays, this is not because I trust airbnb(I experienced an worst situation with my earlier stay from other host in the same town {DM Alvir’s place, Maati} but airbnb haven’t taken care of my complaints even after sharing images and so lost trust on airbnb)
I strongly recommend this property for your short & long term stays and this host & his team is always available just a message away to respond quickly to attend on your needs.",8 years on Airbnb
