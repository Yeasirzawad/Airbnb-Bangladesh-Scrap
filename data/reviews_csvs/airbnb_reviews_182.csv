Private vehicle has no smoth access due very narrow passage which will surprises to any guest and no info about parking space in the listing. the host should highlight all topics into description to avoid any misunderstanding at later stage. I would like to thank Airbnb to understand and agree issues and refund full amount. the host not helping to understand and consider in a reasonable way.,6 years on Airbnb
