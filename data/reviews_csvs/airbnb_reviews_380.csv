The area was nice, it was a rickshaw ride away from wherever I had to go within Uttara. I felt secured inside the house and in the neighborhood.
That marks the end of good things to say. The gatekeeper mr. joynal was a nightmare to deal with. His constants grunts and unwelcoming behavior made me think twice to come back here at night. I was in Dhaka for a marriage in the family and had to returned back only once around past 12AM. What a nightmare it was to face mr. joynal and hear his constant complains about opening the gate so late. My wife gave him 500 bdt before we left, which still bothers me because I don't think it was deserved.
The apartment itself was nice, a standard Uttara apartment so to say. But the mattresses were hard and stiff. Specially in one of the main bedrooms. We had to borrow mattress topper from friends before being able to use it. The kitchen was dirty, there were cockroaches running around there.","Windsor, Connecticut"
