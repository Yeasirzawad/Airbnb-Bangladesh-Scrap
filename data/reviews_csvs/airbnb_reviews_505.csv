The washroom had no light. The kitchen was of no use had to pay extra for the gas, which was not worth paying. They did not provide us towel as well. The location was not good very secluded area. Totally not worth the money, we could have stayed at better place in the same budget. Not satisfied at all. You just can’t stay inside the room during daytime as well as night, too hot and humid they have only fans in the room. We could have got better hotel at the same price",9 months on Airbnb
