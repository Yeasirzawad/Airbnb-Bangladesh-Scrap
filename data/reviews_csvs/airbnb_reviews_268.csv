It is attached right next to the infamous Shialbari Bosti (slum). Dogs barking all night, so won’t be able to sleep at night. Place was not at all clean and maintained. The worst part is the security guards downstairs, very rude!! Locks the gate and shuts down the elevator at 11. If you come back from a night out you are forced to take the stairs upstairs to this flat, and mind it, this place is on the 8th floor. I had serious chest pains and got sick climbing stairs to the 8th floor. Airbnb should look into this matter!! If you have breathing or asthma problems, this place is not suitable.
