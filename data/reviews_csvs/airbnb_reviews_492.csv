We booked the stay after looking at the photos, but when we reached the stay, we found out that the pictures were very misleading.
The room was very small and the two single beds were placed at right angles(as there was no other way to accommodate two beds in that room).
The stay is not like a homestay, it was just a very small hostel like room on the third floor(no lift) with no attached bathroom.
Photos have been put very smartly and lot of things are not mentioned on the airbnb page.
Good things:
-Good for solo bagpackers for just the night stay.
Bad things (Can't figure out from the reviews and photos):
-Not worth the money
-you have to climb all the way to 3rd floor with luggage
-small congested rooms with no space to keep your luggage or move around
-common bathroom
-dirty rooms with spiderweb and ants and rat too
-too much inside the market and cabs get stuck in narrow lanes
-not many Veg food options around
-no ceiling fan, you have option to use AC on extra charge",7 years on Airbnb
