The time we spent there was magnificent, from the giant-screen movie experience to the sky-gazing in the private, rooftop patio. It's worth the money, friendly environment and zero concern - creating the best experience one could ever imagine. I'd definitely come back real soon and give the host a 5/5 for his place and hosting capabilities.",2 years on Airbnb
