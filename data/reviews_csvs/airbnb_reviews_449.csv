To begin the review, the hosts are awesome people, the hospitality they have to offer is top notch. The pros and cons are as listed below:
2. Pros
(a) Rooms from within are really well kept and well maintained. The touch of antique furniture enhances the beauty
(b) Nice ambience
(c) Nice collection of books
(d) Nice balcony.
(e) Well maintained washroom
3. Cons
(a) Locating the place is little difficult with google maps.
(b) Location is of residential area, which has many lanes running criss cross, the turns are sharp. Hence little difficult with sedans/ SUVs.
(c) Parking of vehicle is outside in the lane and since the lanes are narrow, reversing car and parking car becomes a hassle.
(d) if you are coming as a pet owner, and your pet needs area to roam around and freshen up, it will be difficult for you.
4. All in all the hospitality offered by the owners was fabulous, I really don’t have words to thank them for that, few cons to consider for other visitors.",4 years on Airbnb

Everything was delightful, and the owners were exceptionally polite. Uncle, in particular, was kind, polite, and cooperative. The room was beautifully appointed and worth every penny. Despite its affordability, it offered exceptional amenities that catered to my needs perfectly. The balcony was a peaceful haven with lush plants, ambient lighting, and captivating mandala art—a perfect setting to unwind in the evening, enjoying music or heartfelt conversations. Mornings were equally enchanting, with serene aesthetics and the melodious chirping of birds. I would rate my experience 11 out of 10—it was truly incredible. I look forward to revisiting this property whenever I'm in the city. Many thanks to the owners, including Uncle, Aunty, and their son, for their kindness and assistance.","Lucknow, India"

The location is private, yet very close to the Hongkong market. The room is pristine and artfully decorated with antique pieces, and has a lovely attached bath and a pretty veranda full of plants. However, the usp, as always, is the warm behaviour of uncle and aunty and the exceptional culinary skills of Swagata aunty. 1000/10.",6 years on Airbnb
