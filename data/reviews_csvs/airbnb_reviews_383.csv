It is a really outstanding place. very comfortable and cozy and has all the amenities as listed.
one request to the owner is to update the location on Airbnb where the maps location navigates to a different one from that described. Fortunately I had been to Dhaka before and was able to reach with some effort but for someone new to the city it would be a hassle. (Commenting on Feb 2024)",7 years on Airbnb

Very convenient location. Neat and clean apartment with all amenities. Highly recommended. Mr. Fatik is very helpful and responsive.
Good to keep in mind that, the apartment is very close to the main road, so you would hear honks during the night. There are mosquitoes, which is very common in Bangladesh. Aerosol spray was provided. However, you may want to bring a mosquito repellent as well.
I would definitely stay there again.","Nova Scotia, Canada"

Good location for transport and outside food, there's a super shop just beside the house that helped us a lot.
