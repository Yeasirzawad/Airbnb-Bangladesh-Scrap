Nice location for peaceful sleep. Flat staff very friendly and responsive. Was slightly dissapointed with the cleanliness. Found stains on matress and bedsheet. Toilet didnt look clean and sink had strange stains, probably due to age of facility. The sink tap needs a clean as water does not flow well. Upon entrance to washroom, there is an open space where all old lightbulbs are kept.
The gym was dissapointing as its tiny and in an awkward place on the ground floor with guard and staff watching, no A/C in gym too.
The room is located on the first level and you share the floor with the service staff of the apartment. They are very friendly and accomodating. However, i felt uncomfortable sharing space with the staff and thus kept myself in room and eating out when i could. Kitchen is always used by chefs for owner of building and very dirty. Water filter and air con in room is brilliant.
Blanket provided but too thick and looked dirty. Need to provide bed spread",2 years on Airbnb

But when you reach at the spot, you immediately realize you at the right place. Everything is well organized and the in house manager is so helpful when needed, helps us with the check-in and all other information you might be needing. And to talk about the owner, Muksitul, He’s very responsive and very helpful if you have any confusion.
