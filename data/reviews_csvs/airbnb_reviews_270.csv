The communication with Syed was always top notch, he responded very quickly and provided clear information whenever requested. I also had a quick chat with Syed's mother on the way out, she was very lovely and appreciated our stay. Syed's family was always on hand to reply to our request. All in all, we had a very good stay at Syed's place. I just want to highlight one thing, the apartment is located on the 5th floor and there is no lift, so any guest with mobility issues should take notice of that. Thank you Syed and your family for your great hospitality.",9 years on Airbnb
