Luxurious yet not well maintained, missing amenities. Very cold in the this season; listed heater and washing machine, but wasn’t there.
The place smelled like humidity and the floors dirty and sticky.
No cleaning services but helpful CNG drivers available at all time for extra expenses.",9 months on Airbnb

The modern interior has been lovingly decorated by the owner the open plan kitchen/diner has a warm homely feel the beds are comfortable and the ensuite shower was a delight,fully equipped with ac throughout and tv the children were more than happy! We cant fault this place whatsoever and even enjoyed a barbeque in the outside vicinity..Definitely recommend the Western Villa to oversee visitors. Thank you Muhammad for a memorable experience and for sure we will definitely be back soon!",6 years on Airbnb
