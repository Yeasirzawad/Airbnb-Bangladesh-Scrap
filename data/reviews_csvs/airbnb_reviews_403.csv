Every morning the owner remembered how I liked my coffee and was always smiling and chatting with us. The guest house has really nice decoration and is spacious and welcoming. The tours available with Tapas Dash through the Guest House are fantastic also - really recommend spending at least a day with him and doing a wetlands fishing boat trip. Really enjoyed our stay and would come back again.,6 years on Airbnb
