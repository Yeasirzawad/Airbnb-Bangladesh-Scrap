He arrived at the airport after two hours of us clearing checkout, and also after multiple phone calls. This was annoying and unacceptable when full details of the flight arrival times were given to him and agreed transfers and additional payment.
The apartment itself is clean but certainly not as shown on the published images on Airbnb. It is dated, there are marks on the walls and ceilings, plasters and paints falling off in couple of walls. Showers are not functional as they should be and one had rusted shower head. Not enough crockeries and kitchen utensils present at the apartment. No table knives, forks, spoons given. The TV did not function. The set-up is very basic. We also found couple of cockroaches in the kitchen and resorted to washing all utensils and crockeries before use. The kitchen sink was partially blocked and took a long time to drain.
The hostess Jhumu was a charming lady, and always eager to help, and so was the staff, Yunus who helped us with the luggage and queries.
The apartment is in old Dhaka and difficult to locate however, most rickshaw operators in the Rayer Bazar area knew Jarina Girls School, and that helped immensely, because the apartment is just opposite to the school entrance.
Overall, rating is average. For short stay, a week or so may be bearable. The images on the Airbnb and other sites need to be updated and must reflect the present state of the apartment.",6 years on Airbnb
