It far exceeded our expectations. We loved the peaceful setting. The sun room on the top floor with a grass terrace outside is a great place to relax. Ashraf and the caretaker were both quite helpful when issues came up. We paid to have meals cooked there for us.
It feels like it's in the country, but it's in a quiet gated residential neighborhood with nice paved streets. It's a great place to take walks with family (usually difficult to do in Bangladesh). There's a nice bike there to use. The house is equipped with AC's but no power backup at this point, so it gets warm during power outages.
This is an amazing place! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a vacation combining modern conveniences with the beauty and quiet of nature.","Hutchinson, Kansas"

The house was absolutely beautiful with a great surrounding environment. Although it's a bit far (1 hr ride) from the center of Dhaka, it's definitely worth the trip.
Ashraf was a great host, always replying fast to any query I had. The care taker, Zakir, took good care and made sure our stay was pleasant. I would love to visit again sometime.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
