There must be a catch!
But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Mr. Sayem and his associate Mr. Tarek is the most thoughtful, gracious host.
He provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect!
Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs.
The bed is comfortable, bathroom and terrace are excellent. Location is incredible.
Our main concern was the hospital (evercare) which was near to this location.
So basically the area is quiet but still close to everything you need
But They went way beyond to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable. We will be back soon In Sha Allah",10 months on Airbnb

The house was cleaned nicely before we came in and upon request the host also managed additional parking, aerosols and few other things. The host was very cooperative and always proactive in communication. I would stay here if I come to Bangladesh again.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"

Everything is within the reach of 10-15 mins rikshaw ride. Car would take more time as usual. Mahmudur was very supportive. There were some maintenance issues, which could've been prevented though.

The house was extremely spacious and clean, with lots of towels in each room. With a large supermarket about 5 minutes away from the house, it was easy for us to go out to buy groceries.
The location was in a residential area, so it was safe.
I would recommend this apartment.",8 years on Airbnb

It almost felt like a home away from home. It was very clean and spacious. The netting around the building to prevent mosquitos from entering and the AC’s made it a very comfortable stay. It was well equipped with an ironing board/iron, hairdryers, fridge/freezer, washing machine/tumble dryer. Thank you for making it a pleasant and enjoyable experience.",9 years on Airbnb
