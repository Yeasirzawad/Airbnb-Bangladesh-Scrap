DOHS felt very safe. I regularly went for walks around the area especially around the lake behind our flat. It was so nice.
The flat was absolutely perfect. Everyone who visited us commented on how tastefully the flat was decorated. The flat was clean. The beds were comfortable. The food left for us was thoughtful.
We would recommend this place to everyone.",7 years on Airbnb
