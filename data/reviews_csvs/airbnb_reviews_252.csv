*The apartment wasn't adequately cleaned when we arrived, as there was lots of dust and dirt on the floors / cabinets. We immediately complained. The host sent someone who barely cleaned anything.
*The bathroom window fan was broken in one of the bedrooms, which allowed a large number of mosquitoes to enter. Further, we weren't told that there were mosquito nets in one of the cabinets, so we were bitten badly by mosquitoes on the first night. Lastly, in one of the bedrooms the nails for tying the mosquito net are very low, so the mosquito net hangs very low.
*The washing machine and the toilet in one of the bedrooms leaked.
*The men at the entrance gate were not always there, which can make it difficult to leave / enter.
Positives:
*The host is responsive and friendly.
*The location is good -- nice view of the river and in a wealthy area of Dhaka that has lots of nice restaurants, cafes, salons, etc.
*The apartment is spacious.","New York, New York"
