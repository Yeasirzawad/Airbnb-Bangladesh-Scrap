Abundant sunlight streams through the windows all day long, creating a bright and cheerful atmosphere. This, along with the ample space for children to play, makes it an ideal place for families. We stayed for 22 nights and were very impressed with the fully-equipped kitchen, which made cooking meals a breeze. Zobair himself is a wonderful host, attentive and responsive to our needs.
The location is excellent, with close proximity to Dhanmondi 27. This vibrant area offers a variety of shops, restaurants, and even medical facilities. The only drawback during our stay was the ongoing road construction, which caused some commuting difficulties. However, this is entirely beyond Zobair's control.
The neighborhood itself is not luxurious, but it is safe. Considering the price point, we found the value to be excellent. We would definitely consider staying here again in the future.","Lakshmipur, Bangladesh"
