Stain on the sofa.Bendy legs.Was afraid to sit down.
Bed headboard was loose.Afraid was gonna fall onto my head.
AC was very old.Could not control the airflow.Caught a cold.
I got one msg from the cohost after I informed them before checking out.I found her rude.The msg after that from the host was what it should’ve been in the first place.

I was having inter-city journey from the southern part of Bangladesh to the North and thought of a place to stay, accidentally chose this listing. Don't want to ruin it for everyone or the host but if you're booking this place to stay, it isn't all the images provided here on the AirBnb, so you'll be disappointed there in the first place. Next, the place lacks amenities for guests, such as simple as a mineral water bottle or other hygienic materials. The toilet was left with trimmed hairs from the previous guest. Check-in time was even later than it was mentioned on the website. Don't want to be that person but if you're looking for a value of money to stay and hygiene is your priority as a guest, then maybe have a chat about my comment to the host.","Kuwait City, Kuwait"
