This means there is a lot of calm when we want to rest but we are also near many restaurants /shopping outlets within walking distance . Best place for stay in a busy Dhaka . The house owner is very proactive and ensured the apartment is sparkling clean before our arrival and was responding immediately for any of our queries - this made us feel at home . We will surely come back same place when we visit Dhaka next time .",6 years on Airbnb
