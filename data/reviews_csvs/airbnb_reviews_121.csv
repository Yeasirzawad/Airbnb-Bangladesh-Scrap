Mir deserves a resounding five stars for his outstanding hospitality. Communication with him was a breeze; he responded promptly and effectively to every query, making the entire process smooth and hassle-free. What truly set Mir apart was his willingness to go the extra mile—, he went above and beyond.
I liked the location of the house very much. It's 10 mins rickshaw distance from Dhanmondi - so you have access to all the good restaurants and cafe nearby. There are many shops for groceries just beside the house.
