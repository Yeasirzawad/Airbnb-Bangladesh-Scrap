She helped us a lot to. Her instructions were so clear that it was so easy to find the place. She also arranged the room so nicely. She arranged a very beautiful birthday surprise set up. During our stay we had no issue. She was so caring that she managed everything even she provided us plate and cutleries so that we can eat outside food in the table. I will definitely recommend her. And looking forward to visit at her place again,7 months on Airbnb

From the moment I arrived, Nafisa and her family made me feel incredibly welcome and comfortable. The room was clean, spacious, and had everything I needed, including a comfortable bed and a private bathroom.
Nafisa went above and beyond to make sure I had a great stay - she cooked delicious meals for me, showed me around the local area, and even helped me plan my itinerary for the rest of my trip. Her warmth and hospitality made me feel like I was part of the family.
The location of the homestay is little backward but still it's in a quiet residential area Plus, Nafisa's husband is happy to arrange transportation or provide recommendations for things to do in the area.
Overall, I highly recommend Nafisa's Homestay to anyone looking for a comfortable, welcoming, and authentic experience in Dhaka. Thank you, Nafisa and family, for an unforgettable stay!",1 year on Airbnb
