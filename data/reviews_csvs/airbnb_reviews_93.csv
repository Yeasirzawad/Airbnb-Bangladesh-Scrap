The location, being so close to the airport, made my travel incredibly convenient; and the area also offered an excellent selection of dining options and shopping spots, so there was always something to do nearby.
Shafiq was a great host, always just a message away whenever I had questions and always happy to offer assistance. Additionally, the property's caretaker was equally helpful and made my stay as comfortable as possible. The studio apartment itself was lovely, boasting a great view that added an extra layer of charm to my stay. I can confidently say that every time I visit Dhaka, I'll be looking to stay here again.
