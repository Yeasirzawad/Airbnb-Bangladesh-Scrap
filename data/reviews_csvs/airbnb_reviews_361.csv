I had the best experience, the host was amazing & very helpful- he was trying to make sure our comfortableness in everyway.
Also, the place was clean, close to sugandha beach and with a nice view (if you get the belcony room).
I enjoyed my stay and I will highly recommend this to others.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
