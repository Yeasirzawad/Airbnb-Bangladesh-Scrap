We loved staying at his place even though it was for one night. The location is a nice, safe area in Dhaka, very close to the US embassy. The whole apartment is available for use but only one bedroom and the dining room are furnished. Amenities are decent and the building's caretaker is helpful and responsive too. Do note that the apartment is on the second floor and the building does not have a functioning elevator, so it may not be suitable for wheelchair-bound travelers. Other than that, it was a great place to stay. I highly recommend it! ⭐️","Lethbridge, Canada"

This listing has been my best Airbnb experience among places I stayed in the USA, Europe, and Southeast Asia. In the USA and Europe there is no privacy for a guest, and no separate toilet for the guest room. In comparison, this listing is unique. Here each room has an attached bathroom, a full-fledged kitchen with gas stove, microwave, refrigerator, water filter, electric tea kettle, and usual pots and pans. In addition, there is a living room and a dining room with a dining table and chairs. Natural light is inadequate but that is compensated by adequate electric lights. The bedroom is comfortable and the bathroom has adequate toletries and hot water for shower. Internet connectivity is good. The work desk and chair were like my lifeline. The host himself received me and showed me around the listing. He is a considerate and kind person who allowed me to check in two hours before the published check in time and to check out two",7 years on Airbnb
