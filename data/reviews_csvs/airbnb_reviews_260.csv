The apartment was very clean, location was very peaceful. Both were great at communicating. The apartment looks much better than actual pictures. I will highly recommend this place. I will definitely use this lovely location again for my next trip. And most importantly this place doesn’t deserve any negative reviews. Thank you mr. Masum you are a wonderful person.

The host's appalling behavior and false accusations of theft and property damage left us feeling violated and mistreated. When I saw his accusations I called him to discuss the situation but he was very rude, loud and obnoxious and he cut the call in the middle of the conversation. To make matters worse, the gatekeeper of the building was equally uncooperative and made our stay even more unbearable. The owner informed us that the house frequently hosts weddings and other events.He casually mentioned that people often returned to the house late at night. Despite prior discussions about late-night arrivals due to attending events, the gatekeeper callously denied us entry the first night. It took a heated argument to convince the gatekeeper to let us in on our final night. Avoid this place at all costs.",5 years on Airbnb

It was clean and everything was nicely decorated. My mom really enjoyed the rooms and the fact that all rooms had bathroom. I really enjoyed that most rooms had a balcony so I was able to look out and go as needed. I am happy that I was able to explore Dhaka because of this location. The building itself was very pretty. Masum was great at communication and was always fast at responding. I highly recommend his place!,"Buffalo, New York"

The apartment is excellent and facilities superb, modern, big and very clean. Very secure also with many guards patrolling the residence. Being foreigners in bangladesh we had some language barriers and Masum and his wife made sure they checked on our safety throughout. Masum even helped us personally by making arrangements for an amazing hotel at our next location when we had difficulty booking.
