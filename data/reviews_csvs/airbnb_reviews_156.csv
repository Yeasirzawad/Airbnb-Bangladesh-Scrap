It is also located right near the local police station. Faruque was an extremely kind and accommodating host. I unfortunately lost the first couple of days of my trip due to a bit of illness I had contracted in India the previous week, and Faruque was so kind as to give me some medicine to settle my stomach. He was always very quick with communication and ready to answer my questions regardless of the time. He also made check-in extremely smooth by meeting me upon arrival.

Positive:
-Very good location
-Independent place, no one disturbs, privacy is given
-Rumana was kind and tried to make the stay as comfy as possible, also available on Ramadan
Negative:
This place is not on Western standard, but asks a Western price. Dirty floor, bed terribly hard and loud, small bathroom (I didn't find warm water), kitchen poorly equipped, everything is very old and dirtyish. No supermarket in close range.
What was really unpleasant to me is that I had negotiated with the owner before my stay and he was willing to give me a good discount. However, I changed the dates and he couldn't send the offer anymore, so he said book for a couple of days and the rest is OK or we will see. I asked him how much it would me and he named me a bold price. My answer was that I hope we can find a better price. In the end he asked again the high price, but went down for about half. Local guests I had there all told me I had overpaid.",10 years on Airbnb
