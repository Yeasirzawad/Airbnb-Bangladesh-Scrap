A really nicely decorated home, with all you need for cooking, microwave oven, fridge and water dispenser 😊 Pretty clean I'd say. I found it noisy at first, but it's just how this city is I'm afraid. The apartment is about 10 minutes walk away from an even busier/noisier area, so that's a relief.
The host replied within minutes every time we asked for something, and was very helpful! Appreciate that 😊",11 years on Airbnb
