Nafisa and Hasib are empathetic and generous people. Before check-in, items that guests may need are prepared. They are prepared authentic and delicious food for me, actively chatted with me and shared their experiences with me. They fully understand the financial difficulties I may face as a traveler and have been very helpful in helping me with my travel budget, which I am extremely grateful for. This is the warmest and most comfortable place in Bangladesh. Thank you Nafisa and Hasib, may you live a healthy and happy life.",New to Airbnb
