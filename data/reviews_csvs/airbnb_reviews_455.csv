1. Pros
(a) Easy to locate.
(b) Abundance of space, you won’t have any concerns.
(c) Beautifully setup property, interior and exterior both.
(d) Nice collection of books.
(e) No parking issues.
(f) “Attention to details” is the forte of the host.
Cons.
(a) If the bedroom had a door towards living room, air conditioning could be more effective.
In the nutshell, it is the property i would always keep as my priority one stay always while travelling towards Siliguri. And the con listed is just for the heck of it as I had to write one. Otherwise the host is very welcoming. The property is delight to the eyes.",4 years on Airbnb

My compliments to Khushi for maintaining the standards so well, we could feel just like home . The owner was proactive and highly responsive to our requests which made it even easier to settle at the place. Will surely plan to visit again . Thank you for hosting us.
