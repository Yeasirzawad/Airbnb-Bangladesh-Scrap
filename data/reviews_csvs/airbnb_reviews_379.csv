He was amazing. He made arrangements for our early arrival. Due to early arrival we were put in a different apartment which is only a floor below. Everything was fantastic but there is a serious issue with the damp on the walls in 2 of the bedroom. Damps on the walls gave bad odours at all time. We had to buy air freshener all the time. Another good thing about this place was everything was supplied brand new. Also there was no hot water at the beginning but it was put right the next day.,8 months on Airbnb

The checkin was smooth and kindly agreed to our earlier time. Mr Mokbul’s contact in Bangladesh (Mr Mosiur) was reachable when needed.
Pros:
The place is big and the beds are king size. Comfortable for 3 people to sleep. There was some extra cushions to top up.
Secure with 24 hr guard, good amenities and Mosque nearby.
One of the guard was friendly and accommodating (Shofiqul).
Very good and new ACs, a life saver during heat spell of 38-40 degree. Working kitchen.
Negatives:
The maid who was supposed to come daily was inconsistent.
The access to lift from ground floor requires climbing 8 steps.
Termites on door frames of Kitchen and balcony door.
One of the guard was rude despite telling him earlier about needing lift at 5am for our flight.
The refrigerator door doesn’t close well and our food got spoilt. Asked to look into this but no one came.
To improve: Needs washing machine and more pillows to be a complete unit.",8 years on Airbnb

How could this happen? The kitchen exposes dangerous molecules/mushroom like live bacteria (I have taken picture as a proof). All the drawers are filled with their extra storage material that made me surprise where should we put our stuffs. All the cleaning detergents including soap/ liquid were found empty. No people on check-in, key was handover by the security guard who can not provide any other help. TV remote had weak batteries,, etc. etc. Not professionally maintained!! The people talked over the phone had assistants to help who were kind of go around!! Otherwise the location was excellent and very homely if it is maintained professionally!!","Calgary, Canada"

Morshed the person in charge in bangladesh was also great and addressed any issues we had and was great about respecting privacy, which was a nice change from our prior Airbnb experience in Dhaka.
The apartment seems like it was recently renovated. Furniture and appliances are all fairly new and name brand and worked great. The place overall is much nicer than what you'd expect from the images. There are some extra floor pads/mattresses to sleep on if needed. There is also a smart tv in the living room to watch Netflix and youtube, which was a nice surprise as it was not listed.
The location is also perfect, being on the Dhanmondi residential side it's fairly calm but walking, using rickshaws, and calling ubers were no problem. In the mornings you still got vegetable trolleys and there is a small convenience store nearby to get essentials. Dhanmondi lake is a quick walk away and a nice place to spend mornings or evenings. Unimart is also very close and a great place to do groceries if going to the bazaar is not your cup of tea. There are also lots of restaurants very close by, and ordering delivery through foodpanda was a great experience, and unbelievably cheap, especially compared to door dash or uber eats in the states.
As far as things that can be improved, having more pots, pans and utensils would be nice. Some extra linens are also needed. There's no washing machine either, but Mokbul arranged other methods for us. The building also seems to lack a generator, however, we didn't experience super long power outages, so it wasn't too big of a deal.
Overall I would recommend Mokbul's place to anyone and would definitely stay again if/when we return.","Columbus, Ohio"
