The host was really very cooperative and very friendly. He guided us from the time we started our journey. The climate of the place is very hot so he arranged extra fans which is really appreciated. Any one can go and stay. I really felt a homely atmosphere. I wish him all the best for his future.,7 months on Airbnb
