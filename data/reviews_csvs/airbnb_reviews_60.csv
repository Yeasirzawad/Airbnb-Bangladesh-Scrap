Very responsive however the place is not. The photos that were posted did not match the place that was listed. I believe there is another apartment and the photos that were used was different.
Noticeable smell. Very little kitchen things to use to survive such as spoons or bowls.
The only thing about the place was the host being nice and getting us what we needed but the basic things for an Airbnb is missing. The sofa are very stained up. The bedsheets were stained as well. Clean but stained.
The dressers were very smelly. Just an noticeable smell throughout the house and bathroom.",5 years on Airbnb
