Absolutely spotless clean. It was in a corporate building so it was very safe. The view from terrace was amazing. The care taker organised a bon fire for me, we had a few drinks. I would love to go back and stay there again. Away from the city quiet and relaxing amongst lush greenery.
Only downside is there is no lift or escalators. So if you have elderly people, going up and down may be an issue",9 years on Airbnb
