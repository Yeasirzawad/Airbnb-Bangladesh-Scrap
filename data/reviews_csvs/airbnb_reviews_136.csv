Perfect location in the beautiful secured Gulshan area. We felt safe even at late night. Very quiet flat, rooms are very spacious, clean and well furnished. 2 separate living rooms and 2 separate dining areas make it ideal for big group. Kitchen is very modern with all amenities. In the area there are good chinese, thai, local and continental eateries all around including a french cafe next door. Highly recommended apartment in Dhaka for anyone! We stayed at their other airbnbs but this is certainly premium. Hosts and their staff are always available.",7 years on Airbnb
