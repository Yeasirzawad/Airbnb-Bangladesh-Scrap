It is a bit far from the NJP rain station, I had to fight for a 500 rupee taxi. fare It is away from the mad rush and roar of the main roads, clean and equipped. The host's father lives upstairs and was very kind and helpful. There is no air conditioning, only a fan, and it was quite hot. I did dare to open the windows a bit but there are mosquitoes; they had put plug in repellent dispensers and I think that saved me, because I was surprised to see that there were no screens on the windows. I have suggested that important improvement. It was also a long ride back to the shared taxi stand, which was a struggle, although you can get the inner line permit for Sikkim there (bring a photo. Wizride would be better but you would need a credit card valid in India). For a quick overnight it is fine. The father was able to arrange transportation the next day but for sightseeing it would be better to have a car.",10 years on Airbnb

The place was clean and the rooms and all were good. The hosts Pratima and Raghav were very friendly and helpful. The cafe next to the homestay that they run has incredible continental food. Probably the best I have ever had in North Bengal. Their dishes reminded me of food that I would eat back home in America. So for foreigners living away from home for a long time that was special for us. Also Pratima let our children do Karaoke and play board games in the cafe. They had so much fun.
