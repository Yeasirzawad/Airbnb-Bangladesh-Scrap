The environment is very good, there is a lake around, and it is also very close to the mall, you can walk for 15 minutes to eat. It is more convenient to take a tricycle. The room is clean and tidy, and the internet is good. It was a very good stay experience, and I can continue to live next time!",2 years on Airbnb
