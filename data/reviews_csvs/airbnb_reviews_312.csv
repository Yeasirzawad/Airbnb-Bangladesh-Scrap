It was quiet and peaceful, and our host was very kind and helpful. The highlight was a boat trip up a narrow canal into the national park where we saw 3 otters, an eagle, lots of crabs and mudskippers, lots of deer and other tracks, and a colony of bees, which our guide harvested so that we could try some jungle honey. Yum! We also had 2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, and 2 dinners, and every meal was delicious. It was also nice that dogs were welcome. Some of the photos appear to be a different place, and the boat we took was not the one pictured, but these were not dealbreakers. Overall, we had a good time and would recommend Gol Kanon to others. Thank you!","Dhaka, Bangladesh"

Gol Kanon is an absolutely one of a kind experience, with incredible views of the forest and a wide variety of delicious local food items.

We loved to just paddle of alone into the canals from the cabin.
The boat we borrowed was a bit large, so it was a bit of a stuggle for me to handle it alone against the tidal current. So either go inn to the Sundarban with the rising tide, and go back with the eb. Or try to borrow a smaller boat (or just bring a guide, to help you paddle, if you do not feel like having an actuall adventure...)
Friendly staf, friendly neighbours and a beautifull area both into the Sundarban and on the village side.",10 years on Airbnb

Must be prepared for a full contact with nature (including some lizards in the bedroom, but a mosquito net is provided, and you're sleeping in the jungle, do it's part of the experience). Beautiful location and the food: 5*!! Being a vegetarian was not a problem at all. Thank you for a great stay in the Sundarbans",5 years on Airbnb

The amazing people, great food, and tranquil surroundings made for a truly unforgettable trip which we will forever treasure. Extremely homely, it did not ever feel like we were guests at a resort, but more so like family visiting over. We shall definitely be back to visit Shree Pati and his special family in the near future!!",5 years on Airbnb

More than a resort, it really felt like a home away from home and the family we met running the place are amazing individuals who made our visit there extra special. They always made sure our bellies were full with delicious organic food and I would highly recommend a stay here if you ever decide to go explore Sundarban.

The food is fantastic, many dishes we never tried before. The people are very friendly.
Only downside for me was that it was not clear if transport was included and that the boat from Mongla to the other side was a big hassle where the boatmen kept insisting the price was 1500 (it’s actually 250-300, which we ended up paying after calling the eco-lodge to talk to the boatmen). And the price of the accommodation is quite high and still it felt like it was expected to donate in a box.
Nonetheless I think this is the place to go to in Sundarbans 😃",10 years on Airbnb

The host Sripatti makes you feel very welcome and goes out of his way to please you.
The rooms are simple but clean and very eco friendly.
The foos is delicious and freshly cooked with local produce.
Even getting to the place is an adventure in itself.
I would suggest a minimum of 2 night to really appreciate the location and dont miss the boat trip and jungle walk.
I would love to come back and stay for a longer time.

I had a Robi sim but Grameen works best I'm told. there's a little mobile tower not too far on the other side of the fields and walking 100 mts towards it got me 4g. the food is absolutely amazing. it's super fresh. grown locally and prepared traditionally. being a vegetarian I was worried but it turned out to be the best meals I've had in my two week Bangladesh trip. I was initially booked for 2 nights but I extended. you will be well taken care of and the family there is the sweetest. Nazmul has also been very helpful and understanding. looking forward to going back!",7 years on Airbnb
