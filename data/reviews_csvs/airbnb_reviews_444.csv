This house is located in safe area and easy to access from airport. It is very clean and has good facilities.
It is hard for foreigners to find clean and reasonable hotel in Dhaka, But you will have a very pleasant time here.
I can recommend to stay here.
Thank you so much Mr. Sheikh!",9 months on Airbnb

The apartment was very well furnished, clutter free and very clean. The host and his family have clearly spent some time and love furnishing and modernising this place to a high standard, the number of lighting combinations alone was impressive! We chose this place because of the en-suite bathrooms which were all really well appointed.
Sheikh was extremely helpful an responsive to any and all requests and I will definitely be staying here next time my family and I visit.
On the location, Banani is super convenient to get around all parts of Dhaka and there is a huge array of walkable shops, cafes and restaurants such as North End coffee roasters, Lucknow and I highly recommend the buffet lunch at the Sheraton ‚úåüèΩ
Thanks for a great stay!",10 years on Airbnb

We stayed for a month and enjoyed it a lot because it is not a hotel, it is a home.
It is fully equipped with many appliances and furniture, and all are new. Some are even in their original packages. Kitchen layout is a very functional space for cooking (if you have western expectations).
Air conditioners and ventilators gave a lot of comfort. Internet speed was excellent. It holds video meetings and uploads of large amount of data.
Location for us was perfect. We felt very safe walking, going to groceries shopping, walking to work, ect. Security at the building is also guaranteed.
Communication with the host was outstanding, especially for us that don‚Äôt speak Bengali. The remote host and the local manager at the building were a perfect team to settle any arising issue.
We felt very safe and welcome in the building and in the neighbourhood. We take this occasion to thank the care given to us as guests.",4 years on Airbnb
