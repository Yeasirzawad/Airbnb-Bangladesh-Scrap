The best part was that Hot water was available. Most Airbnb in Bangladesh do not comply with the standard. average This is a good home. I am not very familiar with the area. my friends and family told me it wasn't a safe area. because it was surrounded by a project camp. I did not see any danger myself. it's a new beautiful home. The caretaker was a great guy. very helpful nice and polite. since I stayed there for 4 days, now I know a little more about the area than before I will be back near future. nice and secure home. In most of the places, I stayed hot water was red. This house is perfect for people living abroad.","Wellington, Florida"
