From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly by auntie which made us feel about our own home.
The space was well organized and beautifully decorated with so many souvenirs. The kitchen was well-equipped. This Airbnb was full of modern amenities like washing machine, microwave oven etc. However, the thing which we like the most about their Airbnb was their monster-sized TV and refrigerator. I would give them 5/5 if they were more aware of the cleanliness, otherwise our experience was great.
I would highly recommend this place to my family and friends and next time I will surely make a visit there.",4 years on Airbnb
