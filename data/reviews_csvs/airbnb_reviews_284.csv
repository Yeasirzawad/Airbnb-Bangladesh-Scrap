Very comfortable room. The cleanliness was not ideal, but nothing serious, evidently in these countries what is impeccable for them is not for Westerners. The breakfast was alright. It's overpriced","Vicente López, Argentina"

Although I'm a native of Bangladeshi, I live on my Bangladesh trips, at least in Dhaka in a hotel because I'm independent. Hotel Dhaka Golden Inn, in Banani is now my favorite. There is still old furniture in the rooms, but everything is tip top clean. The towels and linens are fresh. The staff is competent, always helpful and very friendly and does not always hold your hand for a tip. I get back in here when I'm in Dhaka.",9 years on Airbnb
