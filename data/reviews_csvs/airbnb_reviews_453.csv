The place is located inside the main city and all accessibility near by. It’s about 5 to 7 minutes walk from the main gate to apartment. It has a good view.,8 years on Airbnb

The living and dining area were comfortable and pleasing. The kitchen was fairly equipped with dishes and cutlery.
The apartment is in a complex which is easily accessible by cab but not possible for family with kids to walk around. It is located in the city's area where one can easily get Swiggy/zomato delivery done. But to venture out on foot on one's own did not seem possible.
The apartment is surrounded by greenery and one could spot many sparrows from the windows.",6 years on Airbnb

It has a serene ambiance. Unlike other noisy spots, this place offered us a peaceful retreat.
It catered to all our basic needs even parking our car wasnt a hassle. The rooms were cozy, and great view specially during sunsets.
We appreciated the convenience of having everything nearby.
Check-in was smooth and I could do all my remote office works with the wifi provided. To anyone seeking a place in Siliguri, we wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb. It’s more than just accommodation.",5 years on Airbnb

Initially we were skeptical because it was freshly listed but when we stepped in, I realized I had made the perfect choice for our family. Located in the bustling heart of the city, this place was not noisy at all and offered a great experience.
The comfort of the home was not missed, with thoughtful touches that catered to all our basic needs. The rooms’ breathtaking view was a delight to wake up to every morning and relax in the evening. There are four Siliguri’s main shopping malls, many good restaurants, pubs, and entertainment options near by it, which was very convenient.
A modern way of hospitality embracing the vision of digital India was an interesting experience with a smooth self checkin where the host guided us virtually when needed and the prime location allowed us to soak in the vibrant city life effortlessly.
I definitely look forward to return again and to those looking for a place in Slg.",2 years on Airbnb
