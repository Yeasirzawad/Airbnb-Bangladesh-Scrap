Our flight landed in Dhaka quite late at night, and the host helped us immensely arranging a check in at 3am. The apartment was clean and had the amenities listed. Cleaning products were provided, as well as there was someone coming in regularly to clean as we were staying for a whole month.
The best features would definitely be the below:
A. There are 2 garden terraces facing the adjacent lake - which was a good spot to spend some time early mornings and evenings
B. The Uttara North Metro Station was a walkable distance that allowed for fast travel into the parts of Dhaka we wanted to go to regularly
C. The surrounding area is pristine with Lakes, Trees and places to eat and drink
Lakeview apartments are a nice find within the area and we would highly recommend.",7 years on Airbnb

The apartment was also infested with mosquitoes, but the host did provide a mosquito racket. However it was a nice stay and the apartment was clean. It would have been even better if there was an option for maid service. And also if the communication didn’t happen via whtsapp or other platforms outside of Airbnb, especially when no notice was given. At last I think the cleaning fee was excessively high given the circumstances in Bangladesh.",6 years on Airbnb

The place is at 'a stone throw' from the metro railway to get to the city in 30-45 minutes, a perfect opportunity to avoid the traffic congestion in the road , specifically in rush hours.
The host was very welcoming and helpful. He allowed early check in.
It is very close to the airport yet not far from the city with options of both rail and road communications.
Local amenities are not far.",2 years on Airbnb
