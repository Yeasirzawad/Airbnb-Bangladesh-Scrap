The booking via Airbnb is only available for the standard rooms that are too small for 2 or more persons. I had stated we would be 2 persons traveling and was disappointed on being given a dingy room. I ended up paying a couple hundreds more to upgrade to their premium room. The behavior of the front desk also wasn't the most cordial. We found a strand of hair in the morning breakfast of puri bhaji. The room was in need of dusting and the washroom needed refills of shower gel. please improve the deficiencies and I might consider opting for this place again.,5 years on Airbnb
