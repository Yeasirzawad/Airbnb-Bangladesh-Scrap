They have on ground floor own kitchen and can deliver the food to your room :) food was super delicious (Bangladeshi dishes were my favorites). The scenery on the 10th floor was so wonderful! You can call laundry service, which is really super great. The wifi was working perfectly!
The location is approx. 15 minutes from airport and 15 minutes by Riksha from one of the biggest malls in Dhaka called Jamuna Future Park.
