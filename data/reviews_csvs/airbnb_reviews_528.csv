Though I understand there was no refund policy while booking but atleast 30-50% of refund was mandated as I have had similar experience in otherstays and they have provided complete refunds. No offense to the host, but my experience was bad",3 years on Airbnb

Hosts are extremely sweet & highly cooperative.
Some improvements can be made (wash basin, geyser) but not a big deal for a short stay.",1 year on Airbnb
