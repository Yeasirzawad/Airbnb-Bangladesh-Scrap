The room was clean, spacious and comfortable, with a stunning view of the river. The host was very friendly and helpful, and gave me some great tips on what to see and do in the area. The room was also full of art, which added to the charm and personality of the place. I would highly recommend this room to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable stay.",11 months on Airbnb
