The host was so accomodating. We had snacks and drinks readied for us by the time we arrived. Only issue we had was the water a bit rusty so we used mineral water. But ms Zobeida was very helpful and helped us with everything we needed. She also had a security guard and the helper who helped us so much with moving our luggage.,3 months on Airbnb

The space was clean and is located at a central point in Chittagong so navigating to other places was easy. I would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Chittagong","Sanford, Florida"

The place is right across from one of Chittagong’s major parks and plant nurseries, and near a famous Buddhist temple. In an older part of town, many of the most interesting places that give Chittagong its character are within walking distance. The house was beautiful, clean and very big with many appliances. Zobeda also provided many household items - so I didn’t need to buy that many things except for everyday groceries during my 40 day stay. The building’s gatekeeper was incredibly kind, helpful and accommodating and really helped out when I needed it. Zobeda was an amazing host - always reliable and offering any accommodation, while respecting the privacy of her guests. I had a really nice stay!","Washington, District of Columbia"
