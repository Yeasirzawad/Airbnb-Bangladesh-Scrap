They have hotel like staff who take pictures of you and your ID during check in. The route to the elevator is very dirty and dark. The automated lights take some time to turn on and is sometimes very spooky. The mattress is still in its plastic bag. The refrigerator does not work. The AC does not work properly. The blanket provided also looked very dirty.,"New York, New York"
