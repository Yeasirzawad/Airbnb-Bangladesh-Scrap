He and the caretaker were extremely helpful and generous with their time in getting me settled. They had lots of tips for the bustling local area too. The apartment was very clean and comfortable with a fully functional kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. I also like the rooftop area on the top floor of the building. Recommend to anyone who wants to stay in a lively and central area in Dhaka city.",7 years on Airbnb
