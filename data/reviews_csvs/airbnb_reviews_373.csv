People are nice, however they lack proper coordination with online booking. So even if you book online well ahead of time they may still show you another room/apartment of different quality and ask if that’s ok when you arrive there. When we stayed in winter the geyser didn’t work and they couldn’t fix it even though they tried their best with several attempts. However they finally agreed unwillingly on a reduced fair price at checkout to compensate for the inconveniences. This property is ok for on-spot dealing.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
