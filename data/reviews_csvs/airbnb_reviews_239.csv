He was VERY KIND enough to let a few of our guests stay with us and did not ask for any more money, but I was compelled to give him a gift anyway. :)
It is VERY close to the airport (10 minutes or so drive) and we easily got Foodpanda delivered several times. There are many supermarkets and a massive shopping center nearby as well!
We had a minor miscommunication with the onsite manager but that got resolved and he was also very helpful.
Max # of AC usage limit is 2; we used 3 or 4 a few times and due to the building limit, the apartment kept losing power.
A HUGE PLUS: The ENTIRE apartment was shielded with micro nets outside the windows and thus there was 0 Mosquito. This was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOR KIDS and the 1ST time EVER in Bangladesh we stayed Mosquito Free!
We would return again!!","Columbus, Ohio"
