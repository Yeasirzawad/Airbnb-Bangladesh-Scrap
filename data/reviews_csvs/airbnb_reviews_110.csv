It was a challenge to find a apartment which is safe for a foreign girl. Im glad i chose this one. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with exceptional hospitality and warmth. The apartment itself was impeccably clean, spacious, and beautifully decorated. It has a microwave, a fridge with freezer and AC's in both bedrooms. The neighbours are all welcoming and friendly. The amenities provided were top-notch, ensuring a comfortable and convenient stay. The location was ideal, with easy access to shops, restaurants, and transportation. Rana was incredibly responsive and accommodating, making sure all my needs were met throughout my stay. I highly recommend AR Residence to anyone looking for a memorable and enjoyable Airbnb experience in Dhaka. Mirpur itself is really colorful and exciting. The Metro is nearby. We often used the Metro to safe time. I will definitely book it again if i'm in Bangladesh. Thank you so Much Rana :)",2 years on Airbnb

Good for bachelors but Not recommended for foreign families. I felt trapped for no refunds & min 5 nights. How come everyone leaves 5 star reviews for this?
He is good person but he must need to work on airbnb minimum expected standards.
Although Mr. Rana was really very communicative & I must be grateful he got the house ready for me to move in immediately. however, the house in reality was a lot smaller, the kitchen too small to use, the bathroom flush didn’t work was a little greasy, the hot water tap was taped & therefore flooded one night at 1 am, had to leave my keys so that he could fix it. crazy amount of mosquitoes, the bed & mattress was weird & dirty,the was no lounge unlike the photo, the stair was dark & its light didn’t work, since no blanket had to buy one.",7 years on Airbnb
