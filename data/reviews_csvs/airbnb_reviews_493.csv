Check-in was flexible and good. But as the time passed the way of talking is very unfriendly nature and threatening to report asking for money. No mentioned housekeeping resources. Giving very personal comments and misbehaving. Before checkin she didn't mention that money will be extra for visitor but after checkin asking for extra money otherwise threatening to report for visitor.
Didn't like the experience overall.",4 years on Airbnb

It really helps you to get a smooth experience beyond your expectation. I had a great stay with my family at Neera's place during transit to Sikkim and return. Our requirements were less however Neera's facility promises much more.",2 years on Airbnb

The place is a 10-minute walk from the Tenzing Norgay bus stop. You will find all your amenities within walking distance. The place is spacious and well-organised. With two rooms and a kitchen, it is a perfect place for a short or a slightly longer stay. I hope to book again when visiting Siliguri.",5 years on Airbnb

It's away from the main road so no traffic noise. The terrace on the roof with all the plants was beautiful. The apartment was clean and spacious. Having a TV would have been great, but I believe some previous guest broke it before us. Neera has been responsive, helpful and we even got to try her delicious momos!",5 years on Airbnb

Here are the specifics of my stay:
The Airbnb is located in a beautiful area of Siliguri, near the Gurung Basti Buddhist Monastery.
Notably, there is a comfortable couch in the living room, a rare find in many Indian Airbnbs.
The accommodation features 2 bedrooms, each with its own private balcony.
The modern front load washing machine was a positive aspect, although we didn't utilize it during our stay.
Neera, the host, displayed exceptional kindness by providing us with additional cotton bed sheets upon request.
Neera respected our privacy, which is a crucial expectation for many guests.
A notable amenity for tourists was the AC in the main bedroom, greatly appreciated in the humid weather.
