The air-conditioning works well. The Internet connection is good.
You have to share a bathroom. It is on the second floor. It is basic but it is clean. I am satisfied with it and with the price. 300 taka to use the washing machine, 7 kg load. They provide you with a clean towel.
The kitchen has a fridge freezer, microwave, and electric kettle. You can use the gas hob, but usually the young men working there use it. You probably won’t cook anyway as food is so cheap outside.
I can recommend staying here especially since it’s good value for money.",5 months on Airbnb

Waited 1 hr . They cleaned the room then handed over but as soon as i got inside i noticed the AC is missing , asked the attendants they just answered arrogantly, take it or leave !!!
Very pathetic.
Called host tamzid , he was not online .
So i had to leave the place at the middle of night .
Also the room was not specious and the bed sheets were dirty , seems like someone used it and without washing it they put it back .",2 years on Airbnb
