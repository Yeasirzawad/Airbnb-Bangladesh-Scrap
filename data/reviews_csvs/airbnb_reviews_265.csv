Staying at AR Studio Home was an absolute pleasure. The location was perfect, with easy access to Metro station here. The apartment itself was comfortable, and the kitchen was well-equipped. Communication with the host was seamless, and they were always available to help and answer any questions. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Dhaka.""ðŸ’–âœ¨",8 months on Airbnb

A cosy place to relax for a very reasonable price!! This place is in a true residential area, very quiet and away from all the traffic noise which really helped me to do all my work in peace!! Eating places and supermarkets are near by and there are stores who would even deliver whatever you need right at your doorstep without any extra charge!! I mean what a convenience!!
Mr. Rana is a true gentleman and a super host in every sense!! He was always there for me whenever i needed anything and went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable!! It was a pleasure to stay there and i would definitely stay there again!!",11 months on Airbnb

On the ground floor he has a workshop where he creativly creates & fixes his homestays so that they have ""that certain something"" . I think I have seldom or never had a host who takes his job as a host so seriously and fulfills this task with so much passion and heart and soul like Rana. His apartments may not be the cleanest or the quietest compared to what you see in other countries, but you can see that everything is designed with love, that the colors have been carefully selected and what is most notable is that he is always available and friendly, whatever problem may arise. Rana helped me in many ways to get along in the jungle of Dhaka. He drove me even to the supermarket twice and he was very interested in a personal, warm exchange with me. If you are looking for an accommodation in Dhaka for all kind of budgets and tastes, I recommend this experience.",11 years on Airbnb
