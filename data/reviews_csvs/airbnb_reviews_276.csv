Spacious apartment, less mosquito, not much noise considering Dhaka's situation, host tried to accommodate the requested equipment (mostly required because kitchen was under equipped) quite promptly, needed things (shop, hospitals) are not far away.
A better cleaning, smoother check in/out, some sofa, and well equipped kitchen would have made my experience much better.",7 years on Airbnb

The caretaker knocked on my door 4 times in a span of 3 hours and we were hoping to get some rest before our flight! None of those things were mentioned or communicated to us beforehand.
Privacy is important, an Airbnb host should know that. Apparently this host doesn’t!","Boston, Massachusetts"
