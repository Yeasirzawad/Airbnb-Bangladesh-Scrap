Location is about 6kms (15 minutes) from Bagdogra airport and a similar distance from the NJP Railway station. Google got us to the place correctly, but it took us a few minutes to identify in the dark. There is a railway track and a railway gate about 50m away but we did not get disturbed by the sound. The host's mother, who lives on the floor below, was kind enough to make us breakfast and also packed Parathas for us on our request. This was way more tastier than food at the airport or on the flight. She also called a local taxi driver to drop us at the airport. All in all, a very good stay and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",7 years on Airbnb
