This villa has met our expectations in every way. Parking was available in front of the villa. The vast front lawn had beautiful greenery including spice trees such as bay leaves and cinnamon trees. The housekeeper is available 24/7 and helped us check in and out easily. His service was exceptional, we were even able to order breakfast and tea through him! I highly recommend this home away from home.","Calgary, Canada"
