I have now stayed at this place for closer to 6 months, and this time I stayed for 2.5 months. Shahid's place already feels like home to me. Shahid is very responsive and flexible and attended to all my requests. Shahid also found me this amazing driver for my use during my stay. The place is as secure and safe as it can get in Bangladesh. It is located in a gated community, and has a nice park, a walkway built around a small lake, an ATM, 2 supermarkets, pharmacies and a coffee shop within 2 minutes of walking distance. It is also very close to Gulshan, and all the nice cafes and restaurants. Shahid's place is self-contained and I enjoyed my stay at Shahid's place very much and will stay there again when I visit Bangladesh next year.",Sri Lanka

The room was spacious and comfortable, with all the amenities to cook, do laundry, and work from home, which was exactly what I needed.
The location is in a very safe and peaceful area of Dhaka — after weeks in other much more frenetic areas it was a treat to wake up to birdsong rather than car horns!
Mr Shahid and his wife, and the housekeepers, were so attentive. I was ill during my stay and they went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and was cared for.
I recommend staying here to anyone looking for a cosy oasis in Dhaka, and hope to be back!",9 years on Airbnb
