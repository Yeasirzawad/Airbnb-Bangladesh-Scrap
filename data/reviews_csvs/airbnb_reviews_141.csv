The location was perfect, right in the heart of the city with easy access to public transportation, restaurants, and shops. The host was incredibly responsive and provided excellent recommendations for local spots. I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again!","Toronto, Canada"

The apartment was spotlessly clean, had a very good WiFi speed, and was equipped with a washer that I found useful. Tahera responded to my calls/texts almost immediately whenever I needed something. Also, it was a pleasure meeting Ayesha and Shahin Sultana, who were in the apartment to check me in. Hopefully, I get to stay in her place if/when I visit Dhaka in the future.","Iowa City, Iowa"

Overall, the experience was great because the hosts listened to our needs and provided additional materials after we asked. They were in contact with us throughout our stay ensuring we had a good time. If ever we needed extra accommodations, they were quick to provide those materials.
Some things to improve on would be getting better door locks installed on bedroom and bathroom doors. 2-3 of the doors within the apartment would not lock. Another thing to note would be that the shower water pressure was not very good so we ultimately had to use the bucket for quick showers. The hosts could also invest more into providing faster WiFi. We had to use our cellular data most of the time because of slow WiFi.
Overall, the hosts were excellent and we had a pleasant stay.",5 months on Airbnb

They didn't change it for next guest. Didn't maintain any hygiene. Kitchen equipped with old fashioned cookware --aluminium paatil! No glassware .
Host didn't respect my demand during my stay rather they bothered us with lot of maintenance work. Locationwise its good to me but all other thing didn't reach my expectation.
Host must learn how to run a airbnb business with international guest, how to behave, what guests requirements etc

She was kind and responsive to messages. The apartment was quite clean. She really tried so hard to be a great host and we would most definitely stay again. But there were a few problems with the flat that we were not informed of in advance. For example, only one bathroom has hot water. We had to ask for enough towels for everyone and there were not enough keys to go around for our 3 couples. One toilet was not working well, the drain in the master bathroom shower backed up, and the washer leaked. But those were minor issues compared to the respite offered by this sweet little apartment in the heart of Lalmatia.","Galiano Island, Canada"

Very noisy in the morning due to having a big field beside the house which I guess the hosts has no control over. Very difficult to find by pinned location if you order food online. They provided us with hand-soap and toilet papers, after we checked-in but the microwave is way too small for the plates they provided. The bathroom doesn’t have a shower curtain so the whole bathroom gets wet when the shower is taken, no bathroom amenities were there. They provided with a cleaning lady which was extremely helpful. Our overall experience was good but they still have rooms for improvements.","New York, United States"
