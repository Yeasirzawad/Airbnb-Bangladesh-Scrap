Host is cordial & helpful up to some extent. The room I stayed was quite open, airy & full of sunlight. It is not riverside though. :-)
They don't have restaurant attached,. Also there is no nearby restaurant to have food. However hotel reception can order & get food from faraway restaurant .
They have some basic things missing:
1. There's NO option to have coffee in morning. They call some place & can only get a cup of tea. They can't even able to provide hot water in flask & a cup! I usually carry my own coffee & just request for a flask full of hot water. But alas! here they can't give.
2. They don't have lift. They don't have any helping hand to carry the luggage onto 1st floor. So I, an Arthritis patient had to carry my 15 kg suitcase across 18 steps. People with any kind of discomfiture should think twice before booking.
Nice place to stay for young & able bodied people.",2 years on Airbnb
