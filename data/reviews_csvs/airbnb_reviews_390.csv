The host is an extremely kind and humble person. Made sure to communicate everything that we needed to know on time. The host is so thoughtful in providing with all the amenities and resources, one can never think of finding which in an air BnB property.

Beautiful view from the sitting area, as shown in picture. Check in and check out was also smooth. One bedroom has double bed and the other a single bed. Sitting area, which includes kitchen and dining don't have air-conditioning so gets extremely hot on a hot day (our first day...it felt like a sauna) but on rainy day (our second day) or winter days it's comfortable. Bedroom air-conditioning units are old but with Aircon & fan on it was okay on the first (hot) day. Washroom have hot water but the hot/cold taps are old and not mix properly. Very clean place, with lots of utensils and snacks. Except for the air-conditioning and hot water mixture, I have absolutely no complaints. Hope the Host solve the problems mentioned and I would like to stay again in my next visit.","Gatineau, Canada"

I must say, Mr. Fawaz was one of the best hosts with one of the best homes I have ever stayed at given I have stayed at airbnbs around the world.
the place is so beautiful you would never want to leave or at least it will hurt a bit once you finally leave the home. To me, it felt like the place was singing to me. Hands down it was the best airbnb place in the entire comilla region.
Lastly, I would like to thank Mr. Fawaz for being an awesome host who always checks in despite living far from the property. He has been super friendly and flexible through my stay at his place. For sure, if I ever need to stay in Cumilla, I would come back again.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
