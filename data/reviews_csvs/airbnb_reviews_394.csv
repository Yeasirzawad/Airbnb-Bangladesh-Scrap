But a little slow to respond on Airbnb. But to be fair, I only booked the day itself. Upon arrival the room I ordered was not available anymore. I ended up having to take a bigger room anf had to pay the difference (but I got a 25% discount). Telephone number available on a popular maps app.",7 years on Airbnb

Tapas went out of his way to be an amazing host and friend - he picked us up at the station and saw us onto our train, showed us the best places for food and tea, and organised excursions for us to the most beautiful parts of the region. The guest house was comfortable and sociable and the breakfast was amazing. I'd definitely recommend it!",9 years on Airbnb

Tapas picked me up from the railway station and welcomed me at the guesthouse with fresh tea. The rooms are comfortable and clean. You can reach the center of the city in 5 minutes walk or less by Rickshaw . Tapas was a great host and gave me a lots of recommendations of places to visit in the area. He also helped me to get a train ticket for the next day. You can book guided tours for all different kind of tours at theire travell agency! So basically you just have to get to the guesthouse and they will help you with everything else :)) I can highly recommend this place.,"Zürich, Switzerland"

He took us on a tour of the national park and tea plantations then in the evening to a local community show. He is really involved in local charity work and knows plenty of people to help with arrangements. Accomodation is quiet, clean and spacious with a good breakfast on offer.",8 years on Airbnb
