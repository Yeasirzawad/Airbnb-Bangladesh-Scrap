It was a proper accommodation for a small family. The host was very caring all through. I travelled in from abroad and felt like that it was my own home. Everything was in a proper shape. Even they cared for the tissue papers at the dining space which represents the very positive gesture of the host. Housekeepers were available at all time within a phone call distance. I would prefer to visit this again and again when in Dhaka city.,"Toronto, Canada"
