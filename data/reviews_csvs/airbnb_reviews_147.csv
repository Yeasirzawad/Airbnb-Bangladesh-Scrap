The apartment is also in very good shape. The rooms are nice and have sunlight. The person who helped check in (caretaker prolly) was a nice person. Overall, it was a nice stay.
Now coming back to some concern, the instructions need to be a bit more clear since the host is not here and no contact person or number is given which makes it hard to communicate if you have difficulty finding it. Instead of putting auto replies, if the host could communicate and be considerate like my past Airbnb hosts, would've been a more pleasurable experience. And lastly, they should work on amenities. The basics like rug, washroom sandals, bathroom amenities, tissues etc amenities would've been nicer, I found these in my all other stay apart from this one. I hope they consider it.
Thank you for hosting us!","Ajman, United Arab Emirates"

I want to give excellent 👍.
I was too busy with my personal lots of appointments.
Frequently I was going out, whenever I came in one guy every time asked, where are you going?
when I answered, every time he was giving weird looking.
The last few days it was really fun for me.
last day I wanted to spend a few minutes with him, but couldn't see, and I was in a hurry
But overall staying in this apartment was really nice, each room has a toilet, the kitchen was tidy and full of essential stuff, my daughter enjoyed a lot, 10 minutes of local rickshaw drive, we got everything including local foods to cloth store.
I will visit again soon.

I think he designed and organized this apartment for himself, so you will get everything there. We stayed at other places in the same area, but this one is really like home. He tried to solve all the small things we requested. Very humble as a host. Would like to book this place again insha'Allah.","Los Angeles, California"
