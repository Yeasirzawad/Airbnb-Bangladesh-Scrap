Kawser was a brilliant host. Very helpful and kind. He checked in on me multiple times and tried his best to make my stay here perfect in every way possible. On my next visit, if the place is vacant I will most definitely give this place a priority to stay again.
Also a special thanks to the caretaker and his family, absoutely lovely people. I cannot thank them enough for everything they have done.
Thank you.
Until next time.",1 year on Airbnb

Kawser gave us extensive information about the city, restaurants and places of interest. We've never experienced such attention to detail... It was so very lovely to feel so very welcomed.
Communication: Kawser responded to message enquiries promptly, offered helpful “tourist-related information “ the building caretaking, Russel is very helpful.
This Apartment and surrounding buildings are under renovation/construction. Which didn’t bother us much.
Nice furniture, good bed, clean, wifi, smart TV.
The apartment was very well equipped with kitchen utensils, fridge, washing machine and cooktop.
Cleanliness was exceptional. I highly recommendable this place. Thank you for everything Kawser. ——Neha",6 years on Airbnb
