As a tourist, Dhaka isn't the easiest place to arrive into. This Airbnb makes check in as easy as possible by providing a very accurate address as soon as reservation is confirmed, as well as a series of numbers to call for assistance which were all very responsive. I was given apparently the 'small' room, which was still a very good sized room with a double bed. Everything in the flat worked really well, including the Wifi which was very strong. I would definitely stay here again.",4 years on Airbnb
