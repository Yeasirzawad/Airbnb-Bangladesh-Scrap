The experience was nothing short of amazing. The location is perfect—safe, centrally located, and close to everything you might need. The facilities are top-notch, with convenient food options that make the stay even more enjoyable.
Tashmin is an outstanding host, truly dedicated to ensuring his guests have the best possible stay. His proactive approach and attention to detail made me feel incredibly welcome and cared for. The added bonus of free laundry service was fantastic and greatly appreciated.
I highly recommend this place to anyone planning a visit to Dhaka. It's a gem in the city, and I will undoubtedly be returning on my next trip. Thank you, Tashmin, for an unforgettable stay!

The place was a newly built apartment so it was clean and very modern. The view and the structure of the apartment is pretty amazing. With strongly equipped modern furniture and appliances.
It’s an amazing chill place for stay overs with friends. The rooftop pool also added up to the amazing refreshment and time we had! Definitely worth the pay and definitely will be coming back here again soon!","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
