Fans need repairing as its speed is very slow. Windows need repairing too. Otherwise nice and clean rooms. Restaurants are nearby. Lots of dogs in the streets but they are friendly if you maintain a positive posture.
Great value for money stay.",2 years on Airbnb

Be advised to confirm all the amenities that you seek to avoid any surprises once you check in (i found no kitchen, Air conditioning, TV, breakfast and toiletries that were mentioned in the listing). The landlord is flexible with check in timings which is great however cleanliness isn't at par with Airbnb standard. Overall a basic space at an otherwise great location.",8 years on Airbnb
