Fans and aircon saved us from summer heat. Everything is like walking distance. Good food and many shopping options around to explore.

Very responsive. I loved the property location. However, the property needs some maintenances work as the property is old. Out of 4 AC’s Two AC did not work. Some of the windows are very hard to open and close. One of the room’s Toilet flush had some issue. Everyone ( Caretaker, Maid, Guard at the gate) we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. If the above issues are fixed this property can be a good place to stay in Dhaka.",8 years on Airbnb
