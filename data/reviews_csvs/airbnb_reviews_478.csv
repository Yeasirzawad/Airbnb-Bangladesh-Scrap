It is like a 'nest' located at a corner away from the main road and walking distance from Rajdarbar hotel,Hill Cart Road.
The house is on 1st floor where we get access to a big bedroom with washroom,dining,kitchen and a sitting room.Two rooms stay locked.
There is a smart tv in the sitting room but we need to use our login/subscription for netflix etc to access it.The house has a functional kitchen,fridge and utensils incase one wants to cook too :)
Our host-Prashant Ji- is a great guy.He is very active and tries his best to make our stay comfortable.
The house is walking distance from Siliguri station so the loud siren of train/goods train is a spoiler!Also the next house has 6-8 dogs which are great to see from windows butonce they start barking then its real loud!
It definitely gives you a home away frm home feel :)!!",6 years on Airbnb

There's an issue of mosquitoes around that area, however he was generous enough to provide support that mosquitoes don't create a problem.
