It was my first stay with my whole family. The way he communicates, the way he deals its amazing. The place is very net and clean. The character also so cooperative. I would highly recommend this place. If i need to stay further probably i will directly communicate with him through airbnb without any further thought.","Ishwardi, Bangladesh"
