I’ve stayed at another place by this host and they’re amazing! Made me feel right at home. Very cooperative and responsive host. The manager (Hridoy) is quite helpful whenever anything is needed. The area is very central (at least for me); great restaurants and shopping places nearby. I will 100% recommend this place.,"Los Angeles, California"

And this is my fav Airbnb in Dhaka. Location wise this is amazing and everything is close by. Airport is also not that far. Place itself is as described in the listing. Kitchen is well equipped for anyone interested in cooking. Host is very responsive and supportive and I was also allowed to leave my luggage in the morning. Guard is there 24/7 so it’s well secured. The only con I can think of, if you have trouble sleeping, it’s by the road so it’s bit noisy. But that’s the case for entire Dhaka city. But I slept well.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"

The apartment is well-furnished with 2 bedrooms and a workspace. The kitchen had all the promised amenities. Great location near Banani Bazaar and Gulshan2. They provide power backup, a microwave, and even tea, sugar, and coffee sachets. The apartment is well-equipped with tissue wipes, room freshener, and more. The friendly watchman added a personal touch to my stay. Affordable pricing made it even better. I'll definitely return!",3 years on Airbnb
