Firstly, the communication was impeccable. From the moment I made the reservation until the day of check-out, the host was prompt, courteous, and extremely helpful.
The space itself was immaculately clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully decorated. It truly felt like a home away from home. The two master bedrooms and two single beds provided ample space for our group, and the amenities exceeded our expectations. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed to prepare meals, and the living area was comfortable and inviting.
Overall, the location of the apartment was perfect for exploring the city. I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future and would encourage anyone visiting the area to book with this host without hesitation.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
