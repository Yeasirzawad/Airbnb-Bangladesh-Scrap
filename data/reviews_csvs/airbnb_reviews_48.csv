Loved the high ceilings, the lawn and just the overall energy of the place (+the ride to get there)
The host was super responsive and helpful all throughout and can’t wait to escape the city and go here again!","Dhaka, Bangladesh"

I spent one night with my dog, and we especially like the surrounding area (open fields), which was good for walks, and the private garden with tomatoes and strawberries. Shakhawath was very responsive and provided excellent advice regarding directions and where to eat. I am looking forward to my next stay, which I have already booked for two nights next month! Thank you!","Dhaka, Bangladesh"

Nice garden and farming.
Some different types of birds were present for the whole time like Magpie-Robin, Black Drongo and Common Bulbul.
Felt like my village home where noise doesn’t exist.
It was a pleasant experience overall.
The host was very cooperative and provided some critical information upfront about restaurants and that helped to adjust my trip plan.
Will be visiting soon.
Highly recommended for those who want to escape the noise and enjoy calmness.",1 year on Airbnb
