However, we had a few issues during our stay:
1) The caretaker Jewel was very helpful and knowledgeable.
However, his constant presence was not required, or specified, before booking.
2) Wi-Fi was slow, and gave consistently poor signal. Furthermore, availability was limited on multiple occasions, due to data not being topped up, or the modem being unplugged.
3) There was no hot water on the ground floor, which was also not specified before booking.
4) We were advised there would be UK 3-pin sockets. However we were not able to plug into the sockets within most of the bedrooms.
5) There was a constant smell from the drainage, which we had to clean with our own disinfectant.
6) Some of the shower heads were loose, resulting in water spraying around the back of the shower, and onto the ceiling and wall.",1 year on Airbnb

This house makes a trip to Sreemangal a vacation. A bearer and a guard help you feel safe and cared for. The house is spacious. Four of the rooms have AC. Rooftop furniture was added this year and it helps make the roof a perfect spot for a sunset, or coffee in the morning. We were able to rent bikes for the week and this helped us really enjoy the area. The driveway allows for more than 2 cars and gives peace of mind.","Naples, New York"
