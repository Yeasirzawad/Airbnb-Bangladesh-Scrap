Do not go by the first appearance of this flat as you won't even feel like sitting on the sofa or for that matter using the bed as it so dirty. Kitchen smells like anything utensils are not washed properly. The Bathrooms are very small.,2 years on Airbnb

The host was communicative and friendly, which was appreciated. However, I was surprised to find out that a caretaker stayed on the property with guests, which made me uncomfortable initially. The host did help address this concern, but there was an incident where the caretaker entered the property late at night without informing us, which felt unsafe and unprofessional. Additionally, toiletries were not provided, and there were no towels available, which was inconvenient. The cleanliness of the property also seemed to be an issue. Overall, while there were positives, such as the host's communication, the stay fell short in terms of privacy, amenities, and cleanliness.",3 years on Airbnb
