Specially considering this appartment which was not a single point behind than any 4 star or 5 star hotel suite.
All the room were spotless clean. Interior, facilities and amenities were better than anything we can expect. Special mention about the warm welcome we got from manager to the guard, service person or neighbour everything was awesome. We forgot our passport in the appartment while check out and returned back from airport after 30 mins. In that panic situation, the help we received from everyone was remarkable. Really want to thanks Everyone for that.",2 years on Airbnb

The apartment was very spacious for all of us and it was in a good location in Banani (close to Road 11 which has a lot of stores/coffee shops!) There were a couple maintenance issues that came up during our stay but Saleh/Manager Mostafa was quick to send someone to fix it. We did also have to buy a few household items, especially as our stay was long (extra toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, dish towels, etc). Manager Mostafa, the doormen, the woman that takes the garbage everyday, and any others working at that building were a delight to us :) Overall, we had a great stay - I would recommend this place for your next stay in Dhaka!","Ottawa, Canada"

The power did go out the first night but it was well taken care of after letting the building maintenance know. Saleh was really flexible with my check in. Worth the price and staying at one of his buildings!,"Berrien Springs, Michigan"
