Thanks to him for sharing his beautifully decorated place. Just little confused about what part of his place we can access, probably because of my weak communication skill.

The place was very nice and beautiful, with an especially stunning view from the balcony. The antique collections throughout the apartment made it feel like I was visiting a resourceful museum. I particularly enjoyed the collection of cameras. Mr. Palash was a culturally minded man and it was evident in the paintings and collection throughout the apartment.
The location was easy to find and located at the heart of the town, yet it was quiet. Although I only booked for two days, I had a commitment to attend, so I didn't stay on the second night. Mr. Palash was very helpful, accommodating and kind about my needs.
Overall, I strongly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in this town.",2 years on Airbnb
