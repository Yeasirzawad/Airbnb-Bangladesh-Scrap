I mentioned this to her as well - I have stayed in several airbnbs around the world but the hospitality and care at Kishwar’s were unmatched. The apartment is very spacious, tastefully decorated and luxurious. This was my first airbnb experience in Bangladesh and I am very impressed. Kishwar is an amazing host, she is warm, friendly and goes the extra mile to take care of her guests. Would highly recommend this listing to anyone looking :)","Tempe, Arizona"
