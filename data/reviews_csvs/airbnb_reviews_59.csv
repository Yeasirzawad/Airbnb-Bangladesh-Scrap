The location is absolutely perfect. The neighborhood is quiet and noise-free, which made it easy to relax after a day of exploring.
The best part was how convenient everything was, with so many great restaurants nearby, and a beautiful park close by. Plus, the surrounding streets are great for just roaming around and soaking in the local culture.
The place itself was clean, and the host was super friendly and helpful, making sure I had everything I needed. I felt safe and at home throughout my stay. I highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone visiting Dhaka.","Toronto, Canada"
