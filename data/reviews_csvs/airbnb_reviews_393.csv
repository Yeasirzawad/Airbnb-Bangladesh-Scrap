They are all very welcoming, friendly and kind - I felt comfortable, safe and at home from the moment I arrived. The house is surrounded by greenery with a beautiful pond out the back. The room is clean, comfortable and quiet. Sawon is responsive to messages and has great local tips - he's also a lot of fun to explore the beautiful surrounds with. I'd highly recommend staying with Sawon and his family.",10 years on Airbnb
