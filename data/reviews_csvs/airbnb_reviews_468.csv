The surroundings are amazingly peaceful and quaint. The location is also pretty well connected. In fact, you will find rickshaws right outside the BnB.
One suggestion though, please do keep a first aid kit readily available as a precautionary measure for ‚Äòin case‚Äô moments.

Hosts were very friendly and welcoming. It was peaceful and private. On the day of my arrival, there was some issue with the electricity, which wasn't actually their fault. It was some transformer issue in the neighborhood. But still, the next day they apologized for the inconvenience and offered complimentary, and yummy breakfast.
Overall, it's the perfect place to stay at for all kinds of trips. I'll definitely be staying at their place the next time I visit Siliguri.",1 year on Airbnb
