Exactly as mentioned in the listing. It's very close to the highway, so it's perfect for those who are travelling by road or to and from the airport. There are lots of veg and non-veg restaurants about 5 minutes away by foot. Swiggy delivers here as well. There are many grocery stores nearby. The host has provided bowls for pets. There is no dedicated parking available but there is enough space on the road in front of the house to park two cars.
The only thing is that there is a leaky tap in the bathroom. The dripping sound makes it difficult to sleep in the adjoining room. Also, there are no hooks for hang clothes inside and the rod on the wall is not enough.
Otherwise, all the amenities are great. Lastly, Rishi 's father coordinated with us throughout and was very responsive and polite. We stayed only for a few hours but liked the place. Overall, a good place at a reasonable price for a short stay.",6 years on Airbnb
