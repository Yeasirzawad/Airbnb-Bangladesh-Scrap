It was 12 hours before the check in. My family was very upset. Host told me about their problems which they could tell me earlier.Flat was nice and specious.First 2 days one AC was broken and 3rd day at night they replaced it. Building has some stupid rules which I wasn't aware of .I hope the host will mention everything before they confirm someone's booking. Overall the flat is nice for vacation. Only thing host needs to be more clear and specific.
Thank you",2 years on Airbnb
