An investigation is on-going. I complained about their cleanliness to Airbnb and provided Airbnb pictures of dirty walls. My remaining 3 days were cancelled by Airbnb but the host got furious as a result. He sent several guys to my door to take me to his office and assault me. I would highly recommend you stay away from this listening. This person is a criminal and he must not be able to continue hosting. I’m proceeding with IGP of Bangladesh to face this criminal.,"New York, New York"
