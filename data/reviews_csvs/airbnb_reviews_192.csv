May not find in the Dhaka city. Crews are great. Nice lawn. Lots of trees. Mr. Ashraful is a nice person.he takes care of his business remotely.if I get a chance to go back. I will try to stay there. No doubt about it. Location of the place 2 famous entities. Awami office, and cross from late Humayun Ahmed. Roads in Dhaka always crowded.little soap shampoo should be in the shower roam. Hot water color was brown. Little mosquito was present which is normal in Dhaka. Over all it is the place to relax. Super quiet.","Wellington, Florida"

Ashraful was helpful and responsive with all my questions.
The house staff were all great and very responsive to our needs, especially Hasan and the khala who did the cleaning.
The apartment looks immaculate in the photos but even better in person. The kitchen was fairly small but still sufficient. It lacked a microwave and toaster but on the last 2 days of our stay we received a microwave. The bedrooms were clean and the big bedroom was huge. The dining area / living area was fantastic. There’s a washing machine and dryer on the top floor which was a nice surprise as we were told they didn’t have one at the time of booking. The rooms were thoroughly cleaned everyday. They gladly will change bedsheets and towels at your request. Hot water was the only let down as it runs orange based on the old tank it comes from.
The location is perfect as it’s in the centre of Dhanmondi.",1 year on Airbnb

We brought our 15 month old on her first trip to Dhaka, so we were quite particular with the property we chose. The home was free of clutter and personal effects, which is so helpful with the dusty environment of the city. Huge windows allowed for plenty of natural light. We were a bit nervous that the beautiful private gardens would increase the likelihood of mosquitoes, but this home and property had the fewest mosquitoes of anywhere we have stayed in the country. There is not a powder room to access from the common space, so just be aware that visitors will have to use one of the 3 en suites. Do not be timid to ask for items that you may need. The kitchen was not stocked for extensive cooking, so ask!","Calgary, Canada"

Communication was quick & always met our needs. we asked for a patio table, and they bought one for us!
There are three men that assist with the upkeep & and security of the grounds + one sweet lady named Ranu, who cleans your rooms. they don't speak English, so use Goo gle translate if you must.
Everything we needed, like bottled water, or to run up our Food Panda order, or to just open the door for you, were met with a greeting & smile!
I'd like to keep it a secret spot, but it's seriously one of the greatest houses I've ever stayed in, in Dhaka! *I'm in no way affiliated with them & just found them randomly on here! They just started doing Airbnb, and they're headed to be a Super Host! 👌🏾 👍🏾
Book this place!","Cincinnati, Ohio"

The host was welcoming, and the property was clean and well-maintained. It had all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The lush garden and surrounding nature provided a serene atmosphere. The interior was tastefully decorated and the accommodations were clean and comfortable. The location was convenient, and the overall experience was excellent.
