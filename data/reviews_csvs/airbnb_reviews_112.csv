Despite being on the GF, it felt very safe. The location is good, very calm and quiet with a nice park to go for walks, (not something you can say about other parts/areas of dhaka).
You have access to a communal kitchen on a diff floor, along with Washing machine, but I didn't use those facilities, but they looked good.
Good internet, the cleaners were lovely and did a thorough job during my stay. There are stores within 5 mins walking on either direction to get all your grocery or takeaway food should you choose.
Internet is fast and reliable. Good host, good communication. The white noise is something that is true but its not frequent, none of the weekends, you are likely to hear generators in pretty much every home in dhaka. so I don't think its a massive issue given how lovely the place is. I don't watch tele, but my only suggestion should be to have a better quality tv, and a better desk chair. I am only saying this because I WFH for my entire stay, so it did get used a lot.
Overall, I do not think there's any other listing on airbnb that ticks so many boxes unless you are going for luxurious serviced apartments in dhaka.
Thankyou",10 years on Airbnb

But I wanted to give this place a shot and I am glad I did.
Dhaka can be a chaotic place. This place is pretty secluded inside a protected zone. Not much traffic around and pretty close to necessary amenities (I shopped at Annona mostly where you can find almost everything).
The place is very clean. You find all the needed necessities (most importantly AC in Bangladeshi hot summer). There is laundry, microwave etc. Makes you feel like home at a North American or European city.
The people are also great. Mr. Shahid is great host. But it’s the guards (Mr. Sohel and Mr. Hashem) that made the differences! I came to the place around midnight sometimes and rang the bell and they were always SMILING to open the door for me. BANGLADESHI PEOPLE ARE REALLY HOSPITABLE.
I wish them all the best and hope to stay there again next time I am in Dhaka.","Phoenix, Arizona"
