The room is very clean. Room service was always at call and adequate. There is a pool but it was dirty for 2 days among the 3 days I stayed , they don’t change the water often.
Other than the dirty pool and the mediocre breakfast the room was perfect clean and so was the toilet.
Arafat was very cooperative and responded quite quickly","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
