I had booked an entire house right in the center of Khulna on airbnb. The host then told me that the house is located 12km outside of Khulna, but that he would have another, better apartement in Khulna for the same price. After I asked about the house again, he told me that it is not available, and I can take the appartement or nothing. As it was already past midnight of the day before check-in, I accepted.
The 'apartment' (which is the accommodation I'm writing this review for) turned out not to be an apartment with two bed- and bathrooms as listed on airbnb, but a room plus a tiny bathcabin inside the apartment in which the host lives with his family. Different from the description it neither had hot water or a mosquito net.
After arriving the host could not give me an explanation why the house was listed but not available, or why the 'apartment' is different from the description.",7 years on Airbnb

The owner was very nice & did his best to be accommodating. However, honestly my stay felt like a bit of a disaster:

There was no towel, no top sheet, & half the light fixtures didn’t have bulbs (plus loose wires hanging out of a bunch of the walls). There were no lights in the stairwell at all, which was nearly pitch black (good thing I had my own flashlight) & littered with garbage. When I asked for a towel & sheet, he apologized that he’d forgotten the key to the storage closet, and told me how to get to the bazar where I could buy my own (wouldn't the right thing have been to either go get the key, or buy a towel to provide? I totally understand that mistakes happen, but it really isn't my responsibility that he left the key).

There was also no wifi. He listed a password, but it didn’t work. He said it was actually the the neighbor’s wifi, as his wifi was out due to construction or something, but the neighbor’s son must have changed the password and there’s no way to get the new one. To be fair he did eventually provide a pocket wifi with a limited data allowance, but that was a bit unexpected (I’m a web developer and the #1 criteria in choosing a place is that it has wifi; the description really should've mentioned that it isn't a true connection).

Once checked in, I headed downstairs to discover that I was locked inside the building. The gate was sealed shut with a giant padlock & I was literally trapped inside, unable to go out to get food. I called him & he came back to let me out - apparently he forgot to mention that from 11pm to 5am the gate is locked. With bars on all the windows and openings, it truly felt like jail. He apologized that he also left that key at home, so there would be no way for me to get out at night (other than to pound on a neighbor's door).

Finally, just to mention it for other guests (I knew this in advance so it’s not a complaint, but you should be aware): there’s no hot water in the shower.

I do fully recognize & understand that this is a low price for a room, but honestly, having a sheet & towel is pretty bare-minimum basic. I also understand that accidents happen re: forgetting the key. But they did have to prepare the room for the next guest at some point, right? There were pillowcases & a blanket on the bed - why not a towel & sheet? And why was a front gate key not just attached to the room key?","Los Angeles, California"

The apartment was very clean and comfortable and Mr Mosleh was a great host. He didn’t stay at the apartment but contacted us regularly to check that everything was OK, and when the WiFi stopped working he came within 30 minutes to fix it. The apartment is on the top floor of the building so there are a lot of steps to climb, but it is in a quiet residential location about 15 minutes walking from Khulna or a short rickshaw journey, and there are lots of good cheal places to eat nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. Thank you Mr Mosleh for you wonderful Bangladeshi hospitality!",8 years on Airbnb
