Bath room very tiny (5ft x 5ft). Rented for 03 guest. No hot water facilities. No generator, no electricity backup for emergency. Fan regulator fixed by without knob . The hotel room is for single host. Behaviour good. I would like to blame the company as innocent information given for three guest. Airbnb is a reputed company, however they've involved in this Monopoly business. Company should aware of host intrest. Please survey the physical structure before enlistment in comparison with facts of living facilities available..",7 years on Airbnb
