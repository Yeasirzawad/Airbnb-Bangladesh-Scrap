The place and the workers though were a bit difficult. We were promised a soft bed but the bed was hard as of Bangladeshi standards. The workers promised to change the mattress but did never show up. There are many cockroaches, no hot water and AC's only in the bed rooms. There are only a few cutleries (only spoons), few plates and no water filter. The door of the house is closed by night and you have to wake the guards to come inside. Additionaly the guards asked several times for tips even though they were not that helpful. When we checked in, the room was not even finished cleaning or not even cleaned at all. Overall a difficult stay. For European standards it is quite challenging I would say.",7 years on Airbnb
