It made some of us feel uncomfortable as we were 11 girls and most of us are girls wearing hijab. It was a little inconvenient.

The place was very neat and clean throughout our stay, all the amenities were present and in working condition.
Robin also helped us figure out about laundry, places to eat and visit in Dhaka. He was very warming throughout our stay.
Shumon, who was handling the daily operations, ensured the food was sent to us on time. Whenever we required anything, he and Robin were a call away.
As we leave for India because of Corona uncertainty, we are extremely happy to have spent last few days here at this place. Would surely recommend you to stay at this place.

For an American, Dhaka seems incredibly scary. The lane outside the apartment seemed scary. We arrived in the middle of the night thanks to Bangladesh’s “worst-on-earth” VISA-on-Arrival process which took over 4 hours.
All of that said, the apartment is nice and spacious. The staff is wonderful!
Mainly, Dhaka, more particularly, the people, are warm and wonderful. It seems exotic. There is minimal tourism I’d say, so if you’re inclined to not having all the tourist amenities, I found Dhaka entrancing and this apartment wonderfully located. Everything is chaotic, busy, colorful, frightening and enchanting. If you like that sort of thing. It is not a resort. The sights aren’t great, but the people make it worthwhile. I loved it.","Omaha, Nebraska"
