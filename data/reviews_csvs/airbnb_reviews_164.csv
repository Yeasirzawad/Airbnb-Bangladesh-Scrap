Indeed, a value for what you have paid for. In one words, I simply felt at home. However, the place may not be suitable for those who are late night comers.","Chittagong, Bangladesh"

The best option for your money. The house is very quiet, tidy and safe. Lubaba accepted me in the best traditions, she made sure that I didn’t need anything. She constantly found out if I needed anything. And she always answered instantly. It was very comfortable, as if I had come home to stay with my parents. Thanks for the wonderful experience!
Location 10/10, you can buy everything you need just a few steps away.",7 months on Airbnb
