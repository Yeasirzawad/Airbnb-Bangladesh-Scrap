Also there is no clocks in any of the rooms which was kind of odd to me. However, the bedroom, living space and dining space interior was very homey and welcoming. I got a little attached to the space when leaving because of how cozy it felt. The maid too was very kind and gets everything done on time!","Toronto, Canada"

I found myself hard and difficult to sleep because of the noise and lighting coming through the windows. My eyes were sore as soon as I stepped inside the apartment because of the toxic chemicals of the painting which the host said they did a month ago. The address was wrong in the first place so you better check twice. I got lost in the banini at 2am and had to take the rikshar to get to this apartment. It's not banani, it's in gulshan niketon, which totally ruined my plan A. Overall, if I had been very well instructed regarding the exact hotel address and had there not been construction and had there not been toxic painting chemicals that hurt my eyes, It was not that bad.",7 years on Airbnb
