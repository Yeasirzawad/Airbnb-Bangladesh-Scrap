We are big on cooking at home and the kitchen was well stocked with utensils and cooking range for us to be able to do that. The place is ideally situated wherein it’s private and yet you can easily walk to the road to find transport and other shopping features. I recommend this place if you want a home away from home in Chittagong.,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"
