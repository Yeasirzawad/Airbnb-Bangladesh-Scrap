It was very clean and they provided daily cleaning which was really helpful.
Regarding the location, it was convenient for us. Easy access from airport. Although we didn’t use that much but super-market and restaurant were within walking distance.
A big thumbs up to the host for providing such a nice facility in Dhaka.
Also thanks to the host family for the welcome snacks. Really appreciate it.
We will definitely use this apartment in future again.","Koto City, Japan"

I stayed in Dhaka for two months with colleagues while working on a research collaboration in Dhaka. The apartment exceeded our expectations. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. The wifi was reliable and a backup generator was helpful during load-shedding, which was happening frequently in Dhaka at the time. Fatemee and his family were kind and very accommodating. We are very appreciative of all their help during our stay. The caretaker, Raj, was excellent. The neighborhood is quiet by Dhaka standards and very safe. We found many great restaurants, shops, and supermarkets within a 15-minute walk or 5-minute riskshaw ride. There are two lakes within 2 blocks away with walking paths.

I chose this property based on the tag “super host” and “premium property” and reviews. But I must admit it was the biggest disappointment I have faced for this trip which I thought I was getting a bargain, but I have grossly overpaid.
The property itself shown in the picture on the Airbnb website does not show the full picture. There are open electric wires hanging from the walls in the living room, dining room, and in the area near the washing machine, these are not shown in the picture and the picture was manipulated in terms of distance and lighting to hide them. The bathrooms were not cleaned properly when I first came into the property. They all have thick limescale marks in the sinks and showerheads and tiles have molds on them. In the family bathroom, there is a wooden cabinet which is very moldy and part rotten which is not very hygienic. The kitchen was also not clean, the stove and the extractor were very greasy. Much of the cutlery provided were rusted and pots have fungus on them which I had to clean to use them. The walls in the property are full of marks. In short, the property needs refurbishment and would not be described as “premium” by me. Also, there were some amenities that were not provided i.e., fire extinguisher, first aid kit, no extra bed linens, no coffeemaker, no iron, and no essentials (soap and toilet papers).
The services provided by this so-called “super host” is also extremely poor and even downright criminal because of the two major incidents I about to mention below.
The first incident I am going to talk about is the host’s attempt to take my and my son’s identity. The host came by our flat and said he needs to take copies of our passport to submit to the local council (Mirpur DOHS Parishad) for security clearance and try to justify this by comparing to how hotels check ID. Note this is after living in the property for 20 days and any ID verification needs to be informed to me before check-in which was already performed by Airbnb. The host never once mentions this before check-in and telling me that it is for security reasons for the secure area that we are living in and 20 days delay is for coronavirus. I was very suspicious when I heard this that is because the security should be more tighten since many nations are in lockdown because of the virus and not loosen it. I immediately contacted Airbnb and Airbnb advised me under no circumstance I was to hand over my and my son’s passport details to the host. The host was still insisting on getting our passport details saying they have been doing this for 2 or 3 years with every guest or at least give him our name, British address, and British phone number so that he can “negotiate” with the council. I have never heard anyone negotiate ID verification with the authorities. I have contacted Airbnb again and heard that the host informed the Airbnb that this ID verification rule came in 7 days before we check-in which is strange because the host said he had been doing this for 2 or 3 years. With these inconsistencies when confronted with the host he told me if I did not give it to him then someone from the council will come and get it. At this point, I did not trust anything this person says so I did a google search found its phone, and try to verify this by calling the council directly. No one picked the phone and no person showed up at our house to collect the passport. If this is not an example of an ID fraud scam, I do not know what is.
Having experienced seeing my friends suffer from financial fraud I will never hand over my passport to a private individual of a 3rd world country who is not a part of an accredited organization and it does not matter who he is and where he lives in PERIOD.
The second incident is where the host sent his caretaker to collect the used towels for replacement. His caretaker came and hurriedly collected all the towels for cleaning, and I did not have enough time to inspect the towels myself before it was taken. After some time, the host’s wife “Daisy” called me from the intercom and literally shouting at me for damaging her towels and at that time I told her I will pay for the damaged towels. Later when I asked the host about this, he was shouting at me saying I have put cooking marks on it and if I do not like their service, I can leave the property early. When they sent the bill of USD16.5 for the damaged items, I asked them to show me the towels I want to see the damage to verifying it which is a reasonable request. But at this time, they are gaslighting me by saying the caretaker already showed it to me which they did not, and they have thrown the towels away, so they have nothing to show me.
Wow, so they are basically falsely accusing me of damaging towels which they cannot show or have any evidence of it. This is completely unacceptable I asked them again to show me evidence and I will pay. Seeing that I am not convinced the host tried to intimidate me by attacking my knowledge on how to use towels and my mannerism so that I pay them.
There is also an incident like the caretaker once came to collect bedsheets when I went in other room to fetch the caretaker went into my bedroom and open my wardrove and inspecting my stuff without permission. This was very scary that is because I assume, they have extra keys for property",5 years on Airbnb

While hotel stays are expected and known to be strictly business with formalities and superficial treatments, personal bed & breakfast and Airbnb stays are meant to be more personalized with a slightly more human touch.
While we stayed at a furnished serviced apartment place in Dhaka in the past, we really were not looking forward to staying at those types of places again simply because of poor quality and lack of 'personal' human element. We hesitated for DAYS before booking our 1st ever Airbnb stay and that also for over a month, taking the risk that if we don't like the place, we'll have to end up getting a hotel.
But Alhumdulillah/Thank God, immediately upon our arrival, we felt we made an excellent decision! Money can buy fake glitters, but not genuine human relationships. After staying here for a month, we truly felt we were related to Mr. Mannan's family.
Their hospitality is unsurpassed compared to the hospitality of any motels, hotels and bed & breakfast places we have ever stayed in; not because they provided a cleaning maid every single day, not because we had a caretaker / doorman who'd buy any essential items for us from nearby grocery or pharmacy, not also because we had a phone in the house to call the doorman or the Colonel Mannan's family anytime for anything, BUT because everyone had genuine smiles at their faces with super friendly attitude, especially the owner's family! They spoke with us as if we were their relatives and they genuinely offered to help us not only about our needs within the apartment, but also with anything in general during our stay in Dhaka.
If we ever have a need for a hotel stay in Dhaka, our 1st choice will be here.
We will miss this place and the hosts!","Columbus, Ohio"

I came to Dhaka, Bangladesh from America and had no idea what to expect. I was a little worried about my safety and just not knowing anyone there. My host went above and beyond anything I could have ever expected to make sure my stay was absolutely perfect, and I stayed there for one month!
The apartment I stayed in is beautiful, clean, and in a very safe area of Dhaka. It comes with security at the front entrance, as well as a caretaker that will run any errands you need. They even send a maid to clean up the entire place every single day. I would highly recommend staying in Mirpur DOHS for anyone coming here their first time. It's a secured military area and you will appreciate all the security all over the area. It makes you feel 100% safe.
Overall, being there for one month I am impressed at the level of care and quality they delivered. I recommend this listing and this host to anyone looking for an absolutely perfect experience!","Bakersfield, California"
