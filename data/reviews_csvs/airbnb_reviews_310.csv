The generous room space provided a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for everyone. Despite a minor setback of having less winter comforters than anticipated, Mr. Mollick's swift response and accommodation ensured our overall satisfaction.
One of the highlights of our stay was the fully equipped kitchen. It was a game-changer for us as a family, allowing us to prepare meals effortlessly. The abundance of groceries available made cooking and serving a breeze. From breakfast to dinner, we didn't face any issues, and the well-stocked kitchen contributed significantly to the overall convenience of our stay.
Mr. Mollick's attention to our needs and his commitment to ensuring a positive experience were evident throughout our stay. Despite the initial concern with the comforters, his responsiveness and efforts to make things right left a lasting impression on us. Definitely worth retuning!","New York, United States"

Mr. Mollick is very friendly and a nice person, but the unit did not at all meet our expectations. The bathrooms and kitchen as well as the light switches were not entirely clean. The laundry machine is not functional so please do not depend on laundry service here. We once went into the kitchen to look for utensils and upon opening the cupboards, there were cockroaches coming out. The unit itself does not have much natural light although it has a lot of room. One of the most challenging parts was that the main bedroom is extremely noisy at nighttime with street noises, to be expected in Dhaka but as we’ve visited the area before, this was a bit excessive. Also, only 1/3 washrooms has hot water which was very inconvenient, plus the hot water runs out quickly and there is no shower curtain. On the plus side, the location was good, the host was communicative, and the staff at the building were kind.",8 years on Airbnb
