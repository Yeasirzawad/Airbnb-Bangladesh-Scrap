Very confortable. A view on the lake and good table to work. (There was even a second screen I could use). The residence is perfect for a single person that needs a working space and facilities to cook own food.
Thank you very much Beum Soo and thanks to the staff that was taking care of the residence.",4 years on Airbnb

It is much better than Pan Pacific Sonargaon where I normally stay. James offers free pick up and drop off from the airport (mind you I arrived at midnight and left at 3 am!). Breakfast is amazing and included in the price. Manik and Nixon diligently prepare dinners and lunches too at nominal prices ($7-9 per meal). They wash and iron clothes for free. The rooms are spacious and 2 out of 3 rooms have a good view over the lake. There is also a car rental service at competitive rates for travel. The location is very handy with a shopping mall within 0.5 km. There are several restaurants within walking distance including Thai, Chinese, Korean food. I found the place very safe. James has been an EXTREMELY helpful host. I had in fact lost my luggage and he took me to a mall to buy clothing! I will definitely be back to his place.","Bethesda, Maryland"
