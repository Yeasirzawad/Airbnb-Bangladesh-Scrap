The guest service was above and beyond great. Saeed’s property manager Himel was very polite and went above and beyond to be at our service at all times. This super exceeded any of my other Airbnb experience. He called transportations for us as well as brought breakfast to us. Not only that, he came and cleaned our unit and offered to even change our sheets. He did not have to do any of that. I can tell you this much with confidence that this type of pre genuine care is rare now a days. We will come back when we visit Bangladesh again.","Irving, Texas"
