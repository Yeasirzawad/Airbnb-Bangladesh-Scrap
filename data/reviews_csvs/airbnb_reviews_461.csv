We are 3 families stayed here just for one day on our journey to Gangtok, Darjeeling etc... The beautiful house is very clean and well maintained. The kitchen and bathroom are spotless. We couldn't find a single thing to complain about this homestay. Host Michelle is very helpful & responsive. We have cooked our own food & there is some problem in gas cylinder but the host arranged a new cylinder within a minute. we also wished to stay one day on our return but unfortunately the house is booked.
After this we stayed in homestay in Gangtok, Pelling, Darjeeling & Mirik but none of these are satisfied us, because our 1st stay of journey was started with a lovely & wonderful stay at MulaqatBNB.
Thank you Michelle for giving an opportunity to stay in this lovely Home. I will always refer & wish to stay here if I visit Siliguri again.",2 years on Airbnb

The rooms and washrooms are very clean, kitchen well equipped with crockeries, utensils, gas stove and refrigerator. The neighbourhood is quiet and the garden space outside the apartment makes the stay very peaceful. She also helped with arranging a drop to the airport.",6 years on Airbnb

She was so helpful right from the start, making sure we landed on time and sent us the required info ahead of time! Would recommend her as a host and the Bnb wholeheartedly!
Thanks Michelle for making our stay amazing!",8 years on Airbnb
