He seemed to genuinely care about his guests, and his quick response when we needed the exact address helped us get through the border in a reasonable amount of time and not miss our bus. The hot water was not working in the communal bathroom when we were there, but Shumon (the manager) let us use the bathroom of an unoccupied private room for our second night. Altogether a good experience and I would recommend staying here.","Seattle, Washington"
