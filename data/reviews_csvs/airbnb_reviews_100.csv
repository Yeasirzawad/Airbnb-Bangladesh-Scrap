Air conditioning was working very well. The host was humble and accessible all the time. The only problem I felt is the elevator, as it is very small and does not work smoothly always. The apartment is in 5th floor, so a perfectly working and spacious elevator would be nice.
Everything else was perfect. The host was kind enough to put some food and water in the refrigerator. Would stay there again definitely!",2 years on Airbnb
