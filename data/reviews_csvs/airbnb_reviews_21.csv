It was right next to the roof and had an incredibly beautiful yard. It was very peaceful when I spent time sitting on this terrace. The house owners were very cooperative. They have always provided support according to the guest's needs.I would like to come again if I visit Chittagong again. I highly recommend this place. Homely environment.,7 months on Airbnb

So consider that if you book in Summer.
In the Kitchen you could heat up something in the microwave but not have a big cookout.
They had a really pretty terrace with pretty plants were you could walk around at late noon.
All in one it was safe there and the neighbours were nice and even send us food for Iftar.
I would visit again",6 years on Airbnb
