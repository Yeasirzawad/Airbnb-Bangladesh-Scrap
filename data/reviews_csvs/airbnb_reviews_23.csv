This was our first time in Bangladesh, we couldn't have found a better place to stay. The flat is big, airy, with large windows in each bedroom- there is everything you might need, and more. The host and/or the caretakers have paid close attention to everything a guest might need and provided for it- from house. We loved the balcony and terrace , and enjoyed looking out into the school playground behind the apartment where one can see school children playing. Our stay was extremely comfortable, and I cannot recommend this place enough. I have to also make special mention of the caretaker, Zahid, who was so helpful and attentive with us. Harun, the host, also specially spoke to me, to ensure that we were safe and taken care of. We are so touched by the hospitality and the attention that went well beyond our expectation. There are also lots of shops within walking distance, and the neighborhood felt very safe.",India
