No complain. But as host mentioned this is not a very clean place. All the furniture and floor felt like they were never been cleaned. I saw thick layer of dust everywhere, left over soap / shampoo packets in bathroom that's attached to bedroom. Also, sink tap didn't have any running water there ( dripping). Bigger bedroom AC doesn't work that well. Took forever to cool down the room.
I didn't have much expectations anyway. Lots of host don't live in the area (sometimes overseas) and someone else maintain the property in Bangladesh. And from my experience i have seen that caretaker lies to host saying it's nice and clean and bla bla bla. But they don't know that just because no one is staying there for a week or month doesn't mean that the place is clean!
No complain to host. He is an awesome guy. I checked in at 3am without any problem. Spacious flat. Close to airport. For the price i paid (thirty nine usd per night) can't complain.","West Seneca, New York"
