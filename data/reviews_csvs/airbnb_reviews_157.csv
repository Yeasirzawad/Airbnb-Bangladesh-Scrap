Loved host's hospitality with coffee and nacho cheese at his restaurant (highly recommended to visit also, such a wonderful decoration and testy food), and breakfast. The home stages very well that my daughter was able to do a TV video shoot inside the house. Always available parking spot, caretakers were always available to support with things to buy from nearby stores, and they even helped with bages carry and any help was needed. Safest, great location to stay and go anywhere in the Dhaka city, walking distance to great shopping & food place Banani 11# road. Never experience loadshedding as they have uninterrupted backup support for electricity, which covered lift & all ACs. The airport is just 20 minutes away (unless rush hrs). only think, I would recommend updating the bathroom commode, which clogged easily as they seem old.
