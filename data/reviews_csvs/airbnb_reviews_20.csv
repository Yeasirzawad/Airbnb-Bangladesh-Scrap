However, it should be known that Keya is solely responsible, she doesn't own this listing herself. This is rented through a party, so this is reflected in communication and the space. You check in at a front desk, where there are often some younger guys who work in the evening and their English is limited, without there being too much trouble. Keya and her colleagues who work during the day are very good in English.
Pool and Gym that are in the pictures cost extra, something I didn't see before getting to the location. 500 for a day pass at the gym and 500 for two hours in the pool. I didn't test the pool as the water was completely green and didn't look very clean. The gym was very nice and well equipped.
I extended my time at this location, mostly because I was lazy and it was close to the airport. Not that it was the most affordable accommodation in Dhaka.
However, I will probably come back if I go to Dhaka again",5 years on Airbnb

however, room is quite small but survivable. balcony view wasn't good, it might be because of 3rd floor. no sound proof door, it can be noisy during day time.

Anowarul Azim,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/295162951,"Rating, 1 star,  · November 2020,  · Stayed over a week","Firstly, the whole place was a mess and lie to what have been advertised still now. Its unhygienic, under construction and unclean from ground to top floors. The stairs are always muddy and dirty and not cleaned. Red ants keep me suffocated in this tiny room. They often comes to bed and I got tired telling the host about it and his inactivity or paying no heed to it. Besides he keeps me telling lot of lies from beginning and its his nature which I found staying there for one month. His place is a 3rd class one with no planning of proper studio apartment concept and so is administration for cleaning. The guys there are sub standard for cleaning and their attitude and manner. I got tired instructing them and they fail to clean it in a standard way all these days. Their timing is also inconsistent and the guy who call himself dm bla bla is a 3rd class person. He is a creep all throughout my period there and most terrible thing is he is a natural liar specially for a man. I found a lot of things hard to accept staying there and those were very much disturbing. One instance I want to share their rooms have no plan and as tiny as one can imagine just to suck money, one night while I was sleeping one mouse was running in my room and coming to bed! OMG, then I called him for help and his attitude was to minor that thing! He was forced to send one guy atlast to my room and I managed after knowing these kinda people to adjust to a different room just asking them to take their time to clean that thing and find out the reason and prevent that. But as I guessed that host guy pretended nothing happened afterwards. But now he was very quick to keep asking me give me reviews in whatsapp. Piece of fokinni shit and fckn money sharks continuously trying to suck money from customers and clients.",5 years on Airbnb
