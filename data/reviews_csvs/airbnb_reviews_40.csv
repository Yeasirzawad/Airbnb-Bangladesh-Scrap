The facilities were very useful for us, specially the water filter and washing machine. Ashik, the host, was very fast on replying to me and he let us check-in quite early. The room itself was comfortable, the AC works very well and the pillows were the fluffiest ever.
About the location: Banani is easily accesible by CNG, motorbike, bus and Uber, every driver knows where it is. I felt quite safe there, even walking at night. There are plenty of restaurants, food & tea stalls, and convenience stores nearby. It's more chill and enjoyable than Old Dhaka, for sure. However, if you plan on going out every single day to more touristic areas, you should take into consideration that Dhaka suffers from horrible traffic, and you'll waste a lot of time coming and going to Banani.
The only problem for us was the mosquitos; there was a spray available, which definitely helped, but a mosquito killer plug-in would've been better.",7 years on Airbnb
