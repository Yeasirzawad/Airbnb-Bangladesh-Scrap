Host was extremely responsive and helped us out however he could. The kitchen was also neatly stocked with most of the essentials. The host also went out of his way to ensure we had all the amenities offered in the listing. If I am being nitpicky, I would suggest some ambient lighting for the bedroom in addition to the tube light but that is rooted more in personal preferences. Overall, very good experience. And 10/10 host.",1 year on Airbnb
