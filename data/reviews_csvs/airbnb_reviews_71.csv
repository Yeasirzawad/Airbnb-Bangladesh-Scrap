However the smell went off after few hours and the exhaust fan was broken identified by the management. The fan didn’t come back during our whole stay and the washroom had that hole unblocked. We had to use it some makeshift card board to cover that up. But essentially mosquitoes got inroads through the whole. So it was a pleasant stay with the place.","Toronto, Canada"
