I don’t know since when Airbnb is accepting roadside lodges also among their property listings …
I don’t recommend this one to any Airbnb guests ….
The bed is like a hard stone
Too much lighting on top of noise coming from the main road so we can’t sleep
It’s an terrible road to book this property
So please don’t. go for it","Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
