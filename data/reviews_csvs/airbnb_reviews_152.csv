He had no cleaning equipment, you call him and tell him but he respond or solution.
I called him when I checked regarding air conditioning not working now he blames it on me even though I mentioned it.
Lastly I mention someone had food poisoning and one of the bathroom was clogged and told him I will pay the charge but he came out very aggressive and rude.","Toronto, Canada"
