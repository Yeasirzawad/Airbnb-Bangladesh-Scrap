First of all that’s true I changed my reservation few times for my travel date & bangladesh visa issues. The host helped me to fix this. I appreciated that. But unfortunately the location very poor. Very tiny rood & people are judgemental. As a foreign citizen I was very scared to stayed their. I don’t know how she got lots of review, may be it’s paid review. Her front door lock not working, master bed room AC not working. They said they will fix after next day. Bathroom lock not working. All furniture are dirty & dust. I was booked for 15 days. But I was stayed 1 days very hardly & I complained to Air bnb, then they refund me all money, instead host decline to refund. I have all proof & photographs. Next morning almost host force me to leave their house very early morning, while my current reservation active. Totally I’m very very disappointed. I never expected this type of problem after traveling 8000 mile from USA.
Good luck for them until they fix everything.
