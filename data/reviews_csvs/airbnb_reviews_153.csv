He and his family were very welcoming, respectful and kind and the host was fast and responsive whenever we needed something.
In addition to that, not many hosts would serve you home-cooked hot meal at late night around 0330am when all restaurants were closed in the vicinity, offering the opportunity for us to observe our sacred fast in the month of Ramadan.
Will definitely recommend his place for others.",4 years on Airbnb
