The place is quite spacious and well-furnished. The owner has taken pains into ensuring every minute detail is taken care of and even installed an AC for us at our request at the last moment.
The place boasts of 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a fully-furnished kitchen with all utensils and a stove, a balcony and a dining-cum-living room. Additional mattresses and bedding is available if there are more than 4 guests.
Our stay at Mr. Ashif's place was quite a pleasant one. The place is a perfect choice for families and bachelors alike. I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Ashif is designated as a Super-host. I will definitely recommend his place to all. Thanks to Mr. Ashif for the warm hospitality!!!",6 years on Airbnb
