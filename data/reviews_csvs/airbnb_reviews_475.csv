What a place. I honestly thought it would be one of those dolled up places that when you arrive it is completely the opposite and in shambles. This was quite the opposite, the spaces are ample. The beds comfy, the furnishings premium. Snom responded within minutes each time to my questions.
It is between Salugura and Siliguri away from both bustles of the city hustle. Also close enough to take a tuk tuk down the way to Hong Kong market or the like. The room is on the top floor in the far corner so road noise is non existent (wake up in peace and quiet) while the view of the setting sun splendid. There is construction going on outside the bedrooms down on the ground but Fenesta premium quality windows to bring everything to the dullest roar.
I almost did not want to write this review because I want to keep it to myself so won’t be booked up next time my family and I are in town but what can you do. Some things must be expressed, impressed and suggest. Pull the trigger.","Provincetown, Massachusetts"
