Rooms and toilets super clean and well designed
Very well connected to the Airport
The host always responsive and very helpful
Caretaker very friendly and helpful
Only bad point is the fact that the area is in development and hard to reach for outsiders but not a big problem at all
as in the future definitely everything in the surrounding will be ready the view was great with a beautiful lake just a minute away
Highly recommend this spot",2 years on Airbnb

It matched exactly with the pictures and it’s worth for the price we paid. However, there could be some improvements. They are very strict with their check out methods. We were supposed to check out at 11 am, and the caretaker came inside exactly at 11 and waited till we left, it was very uncomfortable to get ready and pack everything in front of their care taker. The caretaker was also asking us to wait downstairs for the Uber cause the driver was struggling to find the place which I personally found very inconsiderate. The location is very far from the main city, there are no local shops or restaurants nearby, even food-panda is out of reach in that area. A personal transport is very much needed to enjoy your stay there.",3 years on Airbnb
