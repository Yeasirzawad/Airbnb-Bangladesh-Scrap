The location was perfect - just a short Distance from all the shops and restaurants, but still quiet and peaceful. The apartment was clean, spacious and had all the amenities we needed, including a well-equipped kitchen.
But the real highlight of our trip was our host. They were incredibly friendly and accommodating, and went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful time. They provided us with great recommendations for local restaurants and sights, and were always available to answer any questions we had.
We truly felt at home during our stay, and we can't thank Host enough for their hospitality. We highly recommend Sufia House B2 and would love to stay here again in the future. Thank you for a fantastic experience!""","Los Angeles, California"

But never thought to visit before. I have used Airbnb many times in Europe, it was quiet some experience. Equally I was worried about properties in and around Asia.
Abu’s apartment blown away all my negative mindset’s, even it was better than the apartment I stayed in Switzerland.
Very clean and exactly same as it looks in the listing. I will surely go back soon again. I hope to get the same apartment.
