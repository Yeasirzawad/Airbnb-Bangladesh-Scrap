Clean, and fully set up with kitchen (including gas cooktop, sink, and cooking utensils), two ceiling fans, mosquito netting on all doors and windows, and good bathroom facilities (western toilet and proper shower). Drinking water was easily available. Vaasudev was quick to respond to communication, and very friendly and reasonable. The accommodation was easy to find, and it was tidy and beautifully decorated. Perfect for devotees or visitors to Mayapur, with pictures of Prabhupada and Pancha Tattva in the kitchen and a set of Krishna bowls.
Super close (a short walk away) from many cafes and restaurants, as well as the ISKCON campus.

I had issues with the door lock and handle as it broke and called him multiple times after which he turned up and did nothing. Definitely priced very high compared to other options in mayapur. It is close to the temple. Id recommend booking temple accommodation as there are too many options and very close to temple. Btw.. I was given an option to switch the room to a different one after it broke(after 2 hours) but he said that is not neat and needs cleaning which could take another 2 hours.
Check out with the caretaker was not possible after calling multiple times. He then sends someone after my cab waited for 20 minutes.
Room had basic amenities like geyser kitchen equipments, cloth hanger etc.
