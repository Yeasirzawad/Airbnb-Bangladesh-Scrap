The appartement is perfectly located in Dhaka, you can easily reach old Dhaka or Gulshan. In the middle of Dhaka.
I stayed one month, could sleep with fresh air (a lot of windows) despite the summer. Private bathroom. Shops just in the next buildings, so you can live easily without time management stress.
Park 10min walking away, peaceful and safe area because schools sector.",3 years on Airbnb
