Originally thought I booked the entire apartment but I didn’t, only the room.
Room wasn’t ready on arrival.
It was being used by the host. Then the curtains had to be put on in the room. No duvet either. Just felt like they weren’t prepared for us.
Good size balcony and bathroom.",1 month on Airbnb
