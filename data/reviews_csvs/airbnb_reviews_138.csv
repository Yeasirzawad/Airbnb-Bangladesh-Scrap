‚ÄúHey Cruz, thanks for suggesting their apartment. It was a really great place to stay for a night. There was a restaurant next door and many more nearby. The apartment was nice and clean and I felt at home. I will suggest others stay here if they come to Dhaka. Thanks‚Ä¶ Shaila, for providing the spare key immediately after I locked myself out and left the house key inside my roomüôè‚Äù",3 months on Airbnb

We stayed in all their properties and this is probably the best one. Best location in Dhaka and the price is very reasonable considering its Gulshan. They have coffee machine, and all amenities for you to cook for 100 people. Apartment is very large with lots of private and cozy spaces to chill. Apartment is well furnished and very clean. There were other guests in other rooms but privacy was never an issue. There are many amaying restaurants nearby. We even went on a nice run along the Gulshan lake. German club is also next door. Very very safe neighbourhood. Gulshan can be big and the fact that this right in the centre of Gulshan 1 & 2, it makes everything even more amazing. highly recommend it espcially for foreignes and exapts.",7 years on Airbnb
