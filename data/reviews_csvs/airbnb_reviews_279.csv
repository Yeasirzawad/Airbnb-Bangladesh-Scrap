We became part of the family on our arrival day. Salwa took time to show us some places. The apartment does come with the cozyness of a Bangladeshi home. However, we were always given privacy when we wanted it.
Within 5 days, we really became friends, hung out, had lot's (and I mean lot's) of delicious tea. Highly recommended. Best wishes to Salwa and her mom.","Montreal, Canada"
