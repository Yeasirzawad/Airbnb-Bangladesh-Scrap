The host was unresponsive to messages, had difficulty in finding the place.
The bed linens were used, unclean smelly. The towels were smelly and unwashed. lot of hair on pillows, sofa and on the kitchen platform.
we cleaned the kitchen as traced few big cockroaches. The house has mosquitoes, net to the windows must.
drinking Water has weird taste. The WiFi was sketchy. lost it at night. couldn't complete office work.
was an okay stay!",8 years on Airbnb
