There was a big issue when we checked in. The unit did not have running water. After waiting multiple hours running water was restored around 11:20pm. Host did provide drinking water which was appreciated.
My booking was for only one night, so your experience maybe different.
What I liked:
peaceful location
good Internet
very clean
what I disliked:
lots of mosquito
lack of outlet and poor placement","Boston, Massachusetts"
