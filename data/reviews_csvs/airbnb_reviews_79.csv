The accommodation is very convenient and at the same time in a quiet location. The building and the apartment are new and well equipped. Thanks to the gate with very friendly staff, it offers maximum security. On top the accommodation is very clean. Same with the pool (including a sauna) and the fitness room, that complete the top package.
The handover and return of the accommodation was extremely straightforward. Tareq was very flexible in terms of time, which helped us a lot. Conclusion: Top accommodation that we will definitely book again on our next visit (if available). Thank you very much Tareq!",Italy

We must say this is hands down the best AirBnB apartment in Dhaka. This apartment truly shines, excelling in every aspect from impeccable cleanliness to exceptional comfort. Check-in was superb and most welcoming by the host and his staffs. Everyone from host to building security staffs were friendly and been very helpful during our stay. This was the perfect location for us and whoever wants to enjoy the best of Dhaka. It is very close to Gulshan 2 & 1 circle and Banani road 11 where you can get everything you need. Despite being nestled near bustling areas, this apartment is on level 9 offered a secluded retreat from the lively Dhaka streets, allowing us to feel a sense of serenity amidst the city's hustle and bustle. Loved the apartment's amenities and amazing views from every room. Felt right at home during our stay. Appreciate how the host checked-in with us during our stay to ensure everything was perfect.",4 years on Airbnb
