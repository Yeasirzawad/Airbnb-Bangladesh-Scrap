However, there was no wifi, there were 4 rooms, but one room was not available, and there were 3 beds and 2 cots. There were so many mosquitoes that I couldn't sleep all night. Said there was a grill, but there was no grill. Overall, it was not well maintained. I was disappointed because there was a lot different from what was announced.",2 years on Airbnb
