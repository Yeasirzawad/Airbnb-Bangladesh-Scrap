It is conveniently located near shops and food. Transportation options are within a few minutes walks. Uber and Food Panda pickup/deliver to the address. Place is located on a quiet street. Check-in was very quick and so smooth that it was over before I knew it. Caretaker walked me through all of the questions I had like WiFi password and access. Host has a convenient sheet of passwords, laundry, location info etc. the place was spotless and the A/c worked great. Host has other places available as well so send a message if this place is not available. Host replies very quickly. I will stay at those places again the next time I am in Dhaka.
