If you like to buy it, you can walk to foys lake in a few minutes. It's really beautiful.The housekeeper was also very welcoming, you can find him anytime with any issues, and the host helped me with the pain of not having a local mobile payment, thank you very much.",9 years on Airbnb

Alam is very responsive and stayed up despite my bus being delayed from Dhaka to welcome me to the place. The place is really nice and comfortable with everything that you would require for an extended stay. It feels like a home away from home, peaceful and quiet, being away from the busy main roads and streets of Dhaka. Alam respects your privacy living in the same building and Taher the caretaker is really kind and friendly creating a welcoming and safe environment. I had a really great experience staying here and would recommend you to book. Thank you Alam - I hope to return soon.",6 years on Airbnb
