The accommodation was not only clean but also quite spacious. The check-in and checkout procedures were hassle-free, and the host was very responsive.

He along with his Spouse greeted us during check in. The apartment was spacious and suitable for 4-6 persons. We were a family of 4 persons. There were 2 bathrooms and one common toilet. ACs were functional.
However, a large refrigerator is a necessity for a big family, which we missed a lot. The refrigerator provided was small. Microwave oven was old and it took more than usual time to warm food. Finally, the location has less public amenities. There is no nearby street shop, outlet or pharmacy. One needs to go to the only common grocery store by walking 15 minutes.",11 months on Airbnb

home rather than just ""a place I rented on the internet"". The owners were very friendly and made sure all my needs were met and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. To anyone visiting Dhaka and wants to be hassle free from living in hotels and other rentals, stop searching and this is the home you want to make for your stay.",1 year on Airbnb
