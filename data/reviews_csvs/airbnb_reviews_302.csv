Room is as described and very clean. Housecleaner came by several times a week and would clean my room and bathroom. Lily was really kind an helpful with everything I needed, and even took me around to different markets and restaurants when I asked for recommendations. Location is very convenient, near several restaurants and cafes, but away from the main roads and relatively quiet. Wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Gulshan.","New Haven, Connecticut"

Soni and her husband are both friendly and nice. Its really nice to do a homestay instead of a sanitized hotel.
Details: The bedroom is spacious. The place is very nice. It's incredibly centrally located. Really, for the price its fabulous.","Boston, Massachusetts"

The house is in a fantastic secure location and close to all needed amenities. Both Soni and Rokib were extremely welcoming and responsive, and ensured that all my basic needs were met. Even though I was not able to chat much with them due to my busy schedule during my stay, I felt that the house nicely balanced granting my own space and privacy, and at the same time emanating a familiar home- like feeling that one craves when away from home too long. I highly recommend the place to anyone looking for an extremely, affordable safe and comfortable place to stay in a great location of Dhaka.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina"

She, her husband and her daughter are very nice and polite and are always available for a little chat. I recommend to stay with Soni and her family not only because of learning more about the bangladeshi culture, but also of the room and the position in the city. The room is tidy, clean and everything works. If something is needed, someone of the family will definitely help. The neighbourhood is friendly and it is in comparison to other houses or areas in Dhaka very calm. Best regards from Germany.",9 years on Airbnb

If you're looking for a home away from home, I would highly recommend staying in one of their rooms. It is essentially a subletting situation, so they're always just down the hall if you need some advice interacting with locals or finding your way around the city.

The location is great, far enough from the main avenue that you won't hear too much traffic. It's about a five minute walk to a large market in Gulshan-1, where you can find all sorts of food or fruits, as well as home supplies. If you don't want to barter, there are fixed price places that have more imported items as well, only a ten minute walk away.

The room, with attached bathroom, is very clean and well kept. The AC works great, cooling off the room in a matter of minutes. The shower and sink taps have very good pressure and flowrate.

If you want to explore the city, there are a multitude of ways to travel (rickshaws, cngs, busses, boats, etc.). Soniya has a lot of experience with the city and can point you in the right direction.","Fort Worth, Texas"

They are so friendly, hospitable and always willing to help you around. They can learn you a lot about Bangladesh, both the country and the people, and can tell a lot of nice stories. But also if you want to work, rest or unwind from the city, they’ll give you privacy.
The rooms and bathrooms are nice and clean, there’s good speed internet. The area is pretty peaceful and safe. And a lake for a walk or shortcut to Gulshan 1, so as shops and everything you need, are within 5 min. walking distance.
I stayed with them for 4 weeks and they made me feel at home. So if you want to stay with an openminded Bangladeshi family I can totally recommend staying with them.",11 years on Airbnb
