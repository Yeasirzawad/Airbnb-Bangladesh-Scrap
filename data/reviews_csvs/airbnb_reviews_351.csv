The good part
1. Great view of the iskon temple from the balcony
2. Running hot water in the bathroom
3. Good Wi-Fi speed
4. The host made arrangements for us to visit the places
Areas to improve
1. The place is on the 5th floor. Though the host mentioned lift fixing is in progress, please note it may be difficult for elder people to climb
2. Shower in the bathroom needs to be looked into
3. There is only one plug point in the bedroom above the bed. It needs to be looked into
4, More detailed instructions with photos if possible , is required to reach the host’s place
While we understand the host is new to Airbnb., we booked this place during our 10 days trip on east coast covering Vizag, Bhubaneswar , Puri, Kolkata and finally Mayapur
This was the most expensive place with the least amenities compared to all the other cities that we stayed in , as stated above","Dubai, United Arab Emirates"

Lift was out of service so hopefully it will be fixed and operational in the future as apartment is on the fifth floor. For a short stay the room was comfortable. Nikhil and family made for a good hosts, and Nikhil was very helpful with my needs.",9 years on Airbnb
