Location was great. We didn’t have to go to outside Dhanmondi at all. We were able to shop and enjoy delicious foods near this place. I will definitely come back to this place next time I visit Bangladesh. I would like to recommend Mr. Hasib’s place.
Mr Momin was very helpful. He made check in and check out process very easy to follow. He was very responsive whenever we had any questions. Thanks Mr. Momin.","Sterling Heights, Michigan"

The apartment was nice and very clean. Hasib was very easy to communicate with. He answered our questions quickly and quickly stopped by the apartment when we had a small problem. We appreciated having AC in the bedrooms and the living area. Only one bathroom has a hot water heater, but during hot season a cold shower is okay. This apartment is located in a nice part of Dhaka, and is within walking distance of Meena Bazar, a very nice supermarket. Many nice restaurants are close by as well.
