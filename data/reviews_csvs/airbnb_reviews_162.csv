Read the listing description/ rules prior to and after booking since it has different information. The host requires copies of passports or other forms of IDs from the guests. Now days it is not safe to provide this type information. In many countries the following information is only required from all guests:
- Full name
- Home address
- Nationality
- Passport number
The host can verify the physical copy of the passport, but it is up to the guest if they want to provide copies.
The Apartment is located walking distance to several restaurants, a shopping plaza/building, and many other locations of interest. Uber from the airport are able to arrive within minutes if requested and can be booked for up to 10 hours. Rudmila does has a housekeeper that is required to stay with the guest to provide cooking/cleaning services for an additional price. We did not opt-in for the service. The host communicates timely whenever needed. We had an overall good stay at her place and would consider booking again in the future.","Miami, Florida"
