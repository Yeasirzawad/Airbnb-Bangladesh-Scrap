Only suggestion is that please arrange something for drinking waters as we have buy and carry big jars during our stay . As this property doesn’t have any WiFi facility so we had faced too much network issue as this room is totally inside the complex building. Even in day time we had to use electric lights .,7 years on Airbnb

The apartment building is very convenient to most of the common needs - restaurants, groceries, embassies, hospitals, pharmacies, and banks etc. Throughout our tenure of stay, M.A. was very responsive, flexible, and overall a wonderful host. Besides, M.A.'s staff Mr. Delwar was very welcoming and helpful! We will definitely be back again. 100% recommended!
