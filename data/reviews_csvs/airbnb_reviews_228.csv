On the day we checked in, we were greeted with brand new household items, such as drinking glasses and dining ware. However, cleanliness of the flat could be significantly better. Kitchen appliances were also dirty. On the other hand, the location is very close to the airport as well as local transportation (CNGs and rickshaws). Overall, good value.","New York, New York"
