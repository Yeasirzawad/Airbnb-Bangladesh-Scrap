1. Great Location, just on the main road.
2. Good spacy 2BHK with lift.
3. Nice secured covered parking space.
4. Very Responsive caretaker.
Cons:
1. Very limited utensils, only 2 cups, 2 spoons, 3 plates and 2 glasses. We had real problems as we were 3 persons travelling.
2. Both Bathroom locks did not work, once somebody used the washroom, had to lock it from outside.
3. No toiletries provided, not even a soap. When asked, we were told that they dont provide any toiletries.
4. One washroom did not have any bucket and mug and even the water pressure was not very good.",5 years on Airbnb
