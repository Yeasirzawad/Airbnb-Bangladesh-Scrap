He was very responsive to messages, provided me with all the information i needed, and was flexible with our check-in and check-out times.
The property was clean, well-maintained, and had everything we needed for our stay.
Mr. Raihan also provided us with a number of helpful recommendations for things to do in the area.
Overall, we had a wonderful experience staying at our stay. We would definitely recommend it to others and would love to stay there again in the future.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
