The area is clean, calm and very safe. The apartment is very spacious. All conditions are available, including a washing machine! It’s great that there are many shops, restaurants and even 1 bar nearby. The owner and caretaker will make your life as carefree and simple as possible. The only negative, not of the apartment, but of Dhaka, is mosquitoes, but in the store opposite you can buy a fumigator, which I advise you to do on the first day. Also bring earplugs, the area is quiet compared to most, but the windows in Dhaka apartments do not isolate sound 100%. Having lived in other apartments in Dhaka, for comparison I understand how good this option was for the money, it’s a pity that it was not possible to extend it, since someone booked the accommodation for the following dates.",7 months on Airbnb

Host was responsive. Check In was smooth and flexible without any hassle. 24 hours caretaker was available and helpful. Accommodation was Safe and secure. House interior was little old with little dusty but it was fully okay.
Two things I have to mention. One is place was noisy due to just it was beside of 2 ways road and till late night lot of vehicles noise may hamper your silence. Second is mosquitoes. Even killer spray couldn’t get rid of them. Should use net to get rid of mosquitoes.
Restaurants and other necessary shops were just in a short distance. So place is convenient to move.
So I will definitely recommend this place.","Tokyo, Japan"
