But the place is filthy. There were stains all over the place including the bed sheet.
The bathroom was very unclean with hair and stains everywhere.
This place definitely needs a revamp.","Toronto, Canada"

All staffs are very friendly. Room is neat and clean, away from busy street, surrounded by restaurants and shops.
It is a walk distance from my local principal’s office. I do enjoy the daily 1.5km walk.
Plus the top floor restaurant is a great place with various food available (I continued dining in the restaurant for 4 days, always finished the food).
In short, it is a cost-effective and beyond expectation stay during my this time Dhaka adventure. Highly recommended.",8 years on Airbnb

The only thing I would suggest to the management is if they could use /put another layer of glass (soundproof glass ) to avoid outside noise.",5 years on Airbnb
