He himself pick us up after min-night at the airport and drove us to his flat. On the first day, he brought us to take breakfasr and kindly paid for it. He arranged transport for us to go to Dhamrai that we very much enjoyed. I highly recommend to rent Jahiral's flat if you are travelling to area north of Dhaka on a budget.",9 years on Airbnb

The Room and Washroom were clean and very hygienic. Mr Jahirul had his brother were very helpful in providing all details about Dhaka and Bangladesh. So they guided us on Dhaka travel as well as other rural places of Bangladesh which was very helpful. If someone wants to avoid Dhaka crowd or wants to stay near airport and if AC room is not a must for them, I highly recommend this place at this price point.",8 years on Airbnb

However, Jahirul was very understanding and tried to help as much as possible by finding contact details of relevant people. Also, he waited patiently outside of the airport for us for over two hours while we tried to get our visa. Talking to him over the phone he seemed like a very kind and accomodating individual.",10 years on Airbnb
