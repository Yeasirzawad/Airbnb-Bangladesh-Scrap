Decent place to stay in a VERY good locality
Easy to locate.
Pretty decently sized property
Resident caretaker/cook is very cooperative and punctual when it comes to getting food of her guests’ choice ready in time
The food served in the house is pretty decent
Well ventilated room
The property is in a green locality
Very cooperative and cultured host and care taker of the property
Very large sized bathroom but very plainly kept
Cons:
Does not have a CCTV camera
House including the room needs some maintenance (walls damped at many places, wallpaper is coming off the wall and hanging there)
You may be asked to not use outdoor footwear inside the residence so carrying house/bathroom slippers is a must unless you are okay with walking around the house bare feet
Does not have a WiFi. Airtel works better than Jio here for internet
Windows do have net to keep the mosquitoes out. So you will have to keep the windows closed in the evening.",7 years on Airbnb
