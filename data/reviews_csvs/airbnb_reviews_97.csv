However it was not well cleaned, with old toiletries left in the bathroom and a bottle of KY sex lube left on the table beside the bed. I’m no prude, but it made me wonder what the apartment was being used for. Further, the stairs to the apartment were locked at night with a padlock, which felt like a terrible fire hazard, and the elevator was turned off half the time. Finally, it was difficult to leave the building early in the mornings as the front gate was locked and I had to go and wake up the security guard just to get to work on time. Sorry to leave a review like this, but this is a great place and location that could be an awesome AirBnB if it was cleaned properly and did not have sex lube and old toiletries lying around. I have not reported to AirBnB, but I think these issues need to be addressed if it is to be rented out as a penthouse apartment.",7 years on Airbnb
