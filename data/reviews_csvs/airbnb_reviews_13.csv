Mr. Shahadat went out of his ways to make sure everything is okay with me and gave proper instructions. He also invited me to a home cooked dinner at night. His mother and sister in law were also helpful. Only thing might bother someone is that the washroom is at downstairs and the stay is at upstairs. I went for a brief stay so I adjusted to it. Just a heads up. Overall, a basic homestay with good value for the money.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
