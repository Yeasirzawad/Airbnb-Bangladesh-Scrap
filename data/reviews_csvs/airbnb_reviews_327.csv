Location: There is a discrepancy on the map and the real address. Due to the message response, we couldn't contact the host, we wasted a lot of time finding a check-in point, and asked a lot of people who don't know where this building is, but because it is in the city, it is still convenient to go to every place
2. Environmental hygiene: The living room is clean and tidy
But no washing machine.
3. House equipment: A/C cools well
Fully furnished, but Wi-Fi can't be connected even if it is restarted, no internet
4. Price: The overall price is a little high, it may be that the decoration of the room is better, it would be better if the equipment was more complete.",7 years on Airbnb
