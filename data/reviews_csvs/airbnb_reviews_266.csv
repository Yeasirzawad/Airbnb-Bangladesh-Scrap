This apartment is really spacious with four full bedroom, dining space, full living room with a tons of sitting arrangement. There is a fully equipped kitchen with different new cooking tools. There are three full bathrooms, two attached with two bedrooms and one in common area. That bathroom is huge with a bathtub inside of it. All the bathrooms has both high comod and regular bengali shitter. Common bathroom has a sink inside and a sink outside. Outside sink is close to the dining room, makes it convenient to use. Two bedroom with attached bathroom also had their attached varanda. The House is excellent for a staycation in the busy city like Dhaka with family. Both caretaker and the cleaning lady were helpful and kind. Staying in this place was worth every penny. It made us feel like staying in home, away from home.
I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone for their staycation, or family gettogether.","Lubbock, Texas"
