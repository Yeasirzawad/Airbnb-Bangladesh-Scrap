It is not a 5-star hotel by international standards, but it is clean and the room service menu is affordable and food is well-made. We did have some issues with not being given receipts for room service bills and then being made to pay for them twice at the time of check-out. Keep all of your receipts and ask for them repeatedly as hotel management is not very organized.
Lubaba did her best to coordinate everything and was very prompt in her responses to my questions.","Markham, Canada"
