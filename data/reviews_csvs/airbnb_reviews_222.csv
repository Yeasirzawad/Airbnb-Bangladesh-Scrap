It has nice view from the balcony. The location is ideal for easy access to shops and restaurants. However, I would suggest to keep some mosquitoes protection with you all time.
The flat has all required amenities, furthermore, the host is very responsive and helpful. Any issues I have communicated with the host and he has promptly solved and he always ensures I am having a pleasant stay.
I would definitely stay again in this place 🙌 and would recommend the place to everyone 👍",4 years on Airbnb
