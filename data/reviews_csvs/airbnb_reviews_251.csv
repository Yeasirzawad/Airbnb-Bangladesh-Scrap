He had resolved one unexpected issue during our stay very professionally in a very short time! The beds are quite comfortable. Lighting is great all around. Even this is in an old building, but this place is kept very well and clean. To our surprise this 3 BD apt is quite a big one! The entire place is cozy, comfortable, clean, and well stocked. The location cannot be beat. All the restaurants and the super stores are nearby just a few mins of walking. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and felt like a home in this place.
Kysar was very quick in responding to my queries. Thank you for everything! We will definitely be staying again in your place one day 😊. Kysar is truly a super host.",3 years on Airbnb

He kept the lines of communication open. Whenever I texted him with questions he returned my text quickly. Check-in was smooth and hassle-free. His assistant was so sweet, kind, and professional. Mr. Kaiser was there to escort me into my Airbnb and wait for us to arrive promptly and it was very accommodating when I needed to check out early evening. Mr. Kaiser's apartment was beautiful, and comfortable, and looked exactly like the pictures posted. His building was in a nice prime location and very easy to travel everywhere. 24/7 security by the gate. We had a great stay in Kaiser place. I would recommend his Airbnb and if I travel to Bangladesh, I will plan to make future reservations to stay in his again. Loved it this K's place. It was very easy to find the address.","Ronkonkoma, New York"
