Kainath was accommodating with our early check-in and late checkout, which was especially helpful as we were traveling with a toddler. The place is spacious, clean, and secure, with access to local stores and food delivery services like foodpanda.
Kainath’s flexibility with our check-in and checkout times was greatly appreciated, making our stay more manageable with a toddler in tow. The spacious and clean accommodation exceeded our expectations, providing a comfortable and relaxing environment.
The security measures in place at Kainath’s place gave us peace of mind, allowing us to fully enjoy our time in Dhaka. The convenient location near local shopping stores and food delivery services added to the overall convenience and enjoyment of our stay.","Barrie, Canada"

A very well maintained apartment, spotlessly clean and very tastefully and functionally furnished. Kainath and her Mum were always in touch to provide immediate help and support whenever we needed them.
We look forward to staying at her apartment again.
Thank you Kainath and your Mum. You two have been a great host.",9 years on Airbnb
