He has resolved all the problems I have encountered during my stay at his apartment. He is very kind, soft-spoken, and very prompt. He has called me almost every day to check if there is any issue that needs his attention. He has also sent out a maid to clean the floor and mop it. The apartment is in a prime location and highly maintained. A lot of activities can be done due to its proximity to the lake, convenience store, mosque, and most notably so many nearby restaurants to eat or the foods can be ordered from. I’d highly recommend his place to stay. Thank you.","Austin, Texas"
