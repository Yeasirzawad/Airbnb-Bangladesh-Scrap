You'll stay right at the center of happenings yet just outside the noise of the road. The view from the rooms to the sea is very nice all day. I spent most of my time in balcony of Master bed. My kids enjoyed the stay to the fullest. To some, the approach to the property might disappoint apparently. But once you're inside, it'll wow you for the rent it's been offered. We were welcomed by a local caretaker who was available anytime of the day, very amicable and gentle, and ready to help. The host was reachable as well and addressed our concerns within short period of time. Every space of this property were well utilised. Please remember what you're paying and tune your expectations accordingly and you'll find its a great deal.
I would like to thank both the host and the caretaker for wonderful hospitality that made our family holiday a pleasant and enjoyable one.
Highly recommended!","Chittagong, Bangladesh"
