Staff members are friendly. Same breakfast everyday (which is okay with me but something to share for others), internet connection was very poor, almost unusable. Pool was not clean. Electricity problem was the most challenging part. They did have a generator. But the staff members were keeping the generator turned off rarity of the time. Which made us not being able to sleep at night. There was no water supply for one night. Overall, thing needed to be little more organized. I was informed by the host about the limitations. But was expecting the fundamentals and basics that every hotel offers. The location is in a remote area, but there are scooters, CNGs available nearby. So, that was not a deal breaker for me. Overall, I will give it 4 out of 10 at this stage. Once the construction gets completed, hopefully management will work on the fundamentals to improve the overall quality. It definitely has the potential.","Baltimore, Maryland"
