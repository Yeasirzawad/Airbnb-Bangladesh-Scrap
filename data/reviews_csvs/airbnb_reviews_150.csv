Around the corner is a good restaurant where we ate safely. I mean the neighborhood safely but the food was also neatly made. The accommodation was 4 steps walk and you had to lock 2 doors with a padlock every time. Beds didn't really have a bed frame, so you lay on the floor on a mattress. Despite the situation, they can sleep reasonably well. For the money you don't have to leave it I only found it disturbing for privacy that the landlord regularly entered the apartment and was also often on the shared roof terrace. Maybe we are not used to that and it is a pity that the landlord did not speak a word of English. I would definitely come back because we had to be around Thongi. Thongi we find a too bad neighborhood to stay and then this is a lot better and safer 10 minutes away.",2 years on Airbnb
