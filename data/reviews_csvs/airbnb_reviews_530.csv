Very good location too. But the bare minimum hygiene was not maintained. The toilet seat literally had pee on it, which meant zero effort went into cleaning after the previous guest. Even though the sheets and towel looked clean, I'm sceptical about everything now. Even the toilet in their restaurant, where i unluckily had to go to eat breakfast, had a strong smell of pee.",3 years on Airbnb
