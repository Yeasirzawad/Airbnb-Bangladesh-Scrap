Frantically searching for a replacement last minute, I came across Mr Jahirul's and he saved me! It was my first trip to Bangladesh and being first time I was kind of worried, but Mr Jahirul was very accommodating and responsive - the two most important criteria that we all need. His place was really clean and comfortable. To get to this place which is easily nearby the airport (north of Dhaka city), you would need to use a taxi (as like how you need to get around to anywhere in Dhaka).

What I got by staying here wasn't so much a place to stay, which there were no problems with, but rather someone to help me make my trip a success so that I leave Bangladesh with a very favorable impression. And the mission was definitely accomplished on that front. One thing to note for anyone that will stay here is that the location of the apartment is far from Old Dhaka, but is very close to the airport. If you are curious about Bangladesh and want to explore the country, staying here is a great way to start. These gentleman will help you cobble together your itinerary, and assist with getting bus tickets and being at the right place at the right time. Nearby the apartment is a grocery store, several restaurants (the staff got to know me by name at one of them), and even a spa within 15 minutes of walking.","St. Louis, Missouri"
