Starting with the booking till we checked out, Prashant and his property manager were both very responsive and helpful. The house is in it's own compund with a little garden space. The house itself is very spacious. Both rooms have ACs and both bathrooms have geysers for hot water. The wifi was fast and worked well throughout our stay. They have a power backup that lasts for a couple of hours if the there is a power cut and a smart TV that is ready to use. The kitchen had all the utensils we needed to cook meals during the week, and the area around the house was good for walking our dog.
I'd definitely recommend this place for people looking for a self sustained home in Siliguri.",9 years on Airbnb

The apartment is clean and spacious, it has all the necessary facilities for a convenient stay. The beds are the most comfortable, we had a great rest there. The place is easy to find and Prashant was most helpful in giving us directions on the phone as we were approaching the apartment. There are several restaurants nearby with delicious food and pharmacies open until late if you need one. Also, the apartment is located near the train station and Sikkim National Transportation bus station. So, if you are planning a trip to Sikkim, you only need to walk a couple of minutes to reach the bus or a cab to Sikkim. Thank you, Prashant, for the warmest welcome!",7 years on Airbnb

1) Communication - Prashant reached out quickly after we made the booking, letting us know how to find the place and how to get in. Check-in and check-out were straightforward and fuss-free.
2) Accessibility - The apartment is on the ground floor - perfect for us since we had a lot of luggage. It's also only 500m from Siliguri Junction, where we got off our train. If roads are clear, an auto or Uber takes only 20 minutes from the Airbnb to New Jalpaiguri Station.
3) Food - There are shops nearby, or you can order food from Zomato/Swiggy.
4) Cleanliness - The apartment is neat and clean. Fully furnished with a well-stocked kitchen. The host had kept filled water bottles, both at room temperature as well as chilled.
What could have been better:
1) Insect screens in the bedroom - The living room windows had insect nets, but the bedroom windows did not. We had to keep the windows shut to keep the mosquitoes out.
2) Pricing - For 2 people staying overnight, a bit steep!",6 years on Airbnb

It's a quiet and spacious space with clean and functional rooms. It's a great place to stay if you've just descended from the mountains and need to recover before you fly back home. Or if you've just landed in Bagdogra, this is a convenient place to just relax for an evening before taking off to the hills.
The host is probably one of the best I have communicated with. His food options were spot on (which is so important if you're travelling with family), and so were his cab recommendations.
If you want to visit the buzzling and atmospheric Siliguri market, just cross the road and get into a shared auto/toto for Rs. 20. While coming back, you need to tell the toto to drop you to Gurung Basti Modh (after crossing the bridge). The airport too is just around 40 mins away even during peak time.
