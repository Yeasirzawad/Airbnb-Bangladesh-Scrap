Whatever small issues arise, Moe made sure to sort them out immediately which I found quite professional and is not common in other airbnb’s these days.",4 years on Airbnb

For me NANUBARI was a great find- perfectly suited to my needs - a real sense of quality living and personal space with delightful hosts and helpful willing house staff.
The delightful apartment with its large private terrace was ideal to invite friends and colleagues to - either for meetings or just relax and chill out.
The immediate area is a quiet location
providing easy access to shops, transport, restaurants and endless coffees shops to relax in.
For me a fabulous living experience and with such delightful responsive hosts represented excellent value for money.
Without any doubt my preferred living option on future trips to Dhaka.",6 years on Airbnb

The apartment was clean and exactly as shown in the pictures. The only note would be is that there is no lift to the penthouse but Akram and Bilal helped carry all of our luggage up so it wasn't an issue for us.
We were visiting Bangladesh after many years and it was our first time staying in an unfamiliar location but we were very pleasantly pleased. The neighborhood is also very safe and accessible to many shops, restaurants and parks.
Would definitely book again during our next trip to Bangladesh!",8 years on Airbnb

The room setup was impeccable, and the fully equipped kitchen was a standout feature. It's rare to find a property that not only meets the description but genuinely exceeds expectations. Every detail was thoughtfully arranged, making it a perfect home away from home.
