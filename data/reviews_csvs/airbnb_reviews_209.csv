The place is located in a secured area. it's safe and good for strolling in the morning and evening. Apartment was clean, all utilities was available and as mentioned in amenities. We faced only two issues that the washing machine was not working and the area was far away from any shopping malls, local restaurants markets, banks etc. Procuring daily food from local grocery was little difficult as we have to go with auto rickshaw or an uber as those areas are not at walkable distance.
All in all, I would give a 4 star for the security, amenities, cleanliness and host responsiveness.","Doha, Qatar"
