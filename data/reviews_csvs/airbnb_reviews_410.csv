From the airport its only short journey. 10 mins driving distance. The place was amazing, clean, fully furnished and has everything we would need. It was very close to all the restaurants, shopping malls, and local shops. There were 24 hours of security and view from the balcony was nice. The house was clean and the caretaker Yunus was a very helpful and lovely person. The only problem we had is the beds are not comfortable at all. There was no mattress on the bed and it felt like sleeping on rocks. There are 2 schools right in front of the building, so it a bit noisy in the morning.",6 years on Airbnb

The helper is just a phone-call or shout away. He is very prompt, humble and helpful. Couldn't have asked for a better helper.

From the airport it's only a short CNG-ride, even in Dhaka's famous traffic jam. Located in a quiet side street you can relax in a comfortable home with nice & clean rooms, modern AC-facilities, a spacious living room area and prepare breakfast & meals in a well fitted kitchen.
When you arrive you are welcomed by Hasnat's caretaker Yunus, who is such a dear person that we soon became friends. He even prepared us (jetlagged europeans) a dinner on our first evening!
The building is 24/7 well secured by always friendly guards, it's a 5 min walk to grocery stores or the next busy junction to get a rikscha.
Communication with Hasnat is flawlessly fast & clear.
Thank you, Hasnat & Yunus and all the best!
