Location wise all the points of interest for visitors from out of town is just around the corner. Bedroom is comfortable, living room is spacious and kitchen is cooking ready should you prefer to cook rather than eating out. Parking space for one SUV is available too. It is a perfect space for family, and that's what Rekha and her family prefer. She may not accept your booking if your group is not familial. Anyway, any family traveling is highly recommend this place. Rekha and her folks are so nice and warm.",8 years on Airbnb
