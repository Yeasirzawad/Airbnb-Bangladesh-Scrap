The room's cleanliness, environment, comfort and location was well above average. It had all the basic amenities. The location was great also adjacent to Sughonda beach. The hospitality of Md Ghyas was beyond expectations. He guided me well through out the stay in terms of my outdoor tour and visits. I would highly recommend everyone to stay here and enjoy Cox Bazar",2 years on Airbnb
