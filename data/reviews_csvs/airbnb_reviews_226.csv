The manager was also very nice. However, there is something disappointing. I had my own private bathroom, but it was not private. A group of guests arrived, but there was no bathroom in the group's room. So, I shared a bathroom with the group of guests. They were friendly. I understood that the owner of the house also had a big event, but I was very embarrassed because there was no prior explanation. I even know that the group guests are friends of the owner. So it was disappointing that there was no explanation given to me. The location was good and the facilities were good. The manager was also good, so I am willing to use it again if those shortcomings are improved.",6 years on Airbnb

The host has been responsive and super polite. Definitely recommend this place, specially to women. The only two downsides are -
1. Internet +phone network is terrible,
2. The hot water/shower. The hot water in the shower is warm but not really hot. People with sense body, who showers in hot water, would find the water a bit cold.","Tunis, Tunisia"
