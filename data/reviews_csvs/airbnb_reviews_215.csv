Its just the other room. However, i found this much cleaner and prepared than the previous room.
However, sadly no bed spread provided. Only a blanket that has no cover on, and again looks dirty so did not want to use.
Sadly at the time of booking there was a lot of noise disturbance in the day time due to floor having kitchen construction. Did not appreciate this. They could have carried out work after guest stays.
Once again, uncomfortable with the fact the flat is shared with Tanims servants. Wish the host would have better described this on his airbnb profile. You may get the room but not the floor. Unless you socialise with the workers.
Gym again is not worthy of being called a gym, its a room with a bench as well as some weights and a treadmill. Non AC too.
For the rooms price its not too bad and the staff are friendly as well as being accomodating. Just dont feel the place is to standard expected.",2 years on Airbnb

Great location. Great host.
However, keep in mind - shared room in an apartment with staff living in the other rooms of the apartment. No manual lock from inside the room - felt fairly unsafe - someone with a key can walk in anytime in the room. Mosquitos, but that's a common problem in Dhaka.","Amherst, New York"
