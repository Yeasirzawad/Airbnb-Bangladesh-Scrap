They upgraded me to an AC room in view of the weather and low occupancy, provided a late check-out at a nominal charge, helped with delicious and sumptuous home-cooked meals, and had fun engaging conversations. My stay was comfortable and cozy. The listing is spacious, lush green, home to a lot of pets and everyone (including the staff) is like one big family. Proximity to the airport is a big plus. Thank you Kushal for having me over.",6 years on Airbnb
