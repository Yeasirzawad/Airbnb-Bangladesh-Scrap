It’s in the top floor and was really hot inside the room.
The host did offer to give a different room but I had left the property to check in somewhere else within an hour.
I would say, ask the host to confirm if the AC works or not before checking in. Cannot comment about other things as I had not stayed the duration",5 years on Airbnb
