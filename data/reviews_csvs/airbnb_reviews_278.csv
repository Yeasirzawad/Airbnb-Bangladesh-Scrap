The host was told a many times for room service that she's supposed do in a regular basis but she seems careless and never done a simple cleaning throughout our stay for four days in there. We managed to stay somehow. The host was over professional and lacks hospitality skill.,6 years on Airbnb

Despite positive initial impressions from photos, my experience was marked by numerous issues:
Strike 1: Visa complications & a refusal to provide required contact info started my stay on the wrong foot. The absence of working desk as in the photos led to discomfort, while cleanliness & pest control were inadequate.
Strike 2: Persistent noise from construction & broadcasted prayers disrupted my work & sleep. The internet & power outages further hindered my work. An urgent need for assistance w receiving a shipment was met w obstruction and additional costs.
Strike 3: Upon checkout, I was blindsided by a $350 charge for a non-functional TV that I hadn't even used. My attempt to resolve the issue was met w a baseless accusation of dishonesty from management.
Overall, my experience was marked by consistent problems, unmet expectations, & hostile customer service Renters Beware","Stoughton, Massachusetts"

You can enjoy nice views of the city from the rooftop sitting arrangement. Swimming pool is well maintained! However, many things can be improved, such as the cleanliness of the bathroom, bed linens, pillow covers, and the towels is not up to the mark. Cleaning staffs should be well trained.","Savannah, Georgia"
