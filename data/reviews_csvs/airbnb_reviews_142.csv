He was helpful and easy to communicate via text. The location is ok and quiet. The host provided cleaning and all other amenities so you do not have to worry about buying the daily necessities if you come here for a weekend stay. I came here during the summer so the water gets extremely hot so you have to hold water in the bucket to shower in the evening once the sun goes out or wake up super early in the morning before the sun says ""Hi"" for shower. If you don't shower often then it is not an issue.
This is a studio apartment in a family neighborhood in the DOHS area so it is a secure place and guards on the ground floor (building entrance) keep greeting you all time with a big smile. So far I am satisfied with the stay and I recommend who wants a quiet and serene place to choose his apartment.","Dhaka, Bangladesh"
