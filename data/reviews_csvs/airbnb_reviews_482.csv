And the house was really spacious, and there was air conditioning in each room, so I think I had a very pleasant life at home.
I don't know how nice it was because the host responded really quickly if we needed anything or needed help. 🥹 We were able to adapt quickly here. The washing machine and refrigerator tableware were all good, and the bathroom was clean.
If I come back to Siliguri again, I think I want to stay here a lot.
However, sometimes bugs come out, but you can solve that with bug medicine.. I don't think you have to panic too much:) Thank you for providing such a nice house",1 year on Airbnb
